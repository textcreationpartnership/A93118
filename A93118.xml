            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, I doe deſire in all plainneſſe to bee underſtoo, that having in the time of my ſtudy of the Lawes of this Realme, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſome confuſed Notes and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations out of the ſame: And being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards willing (for God knows, I had no further end or aim at firſt in them) for mine own private help and better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to digeſt them into ſome order and method, ſuch as my underſtanding could beſt contrive. The which things thus prepared and lying by me, came by chance to the view of ſome more learned then my ſelfe, who ſeemed to give ſome good approbation thereunto. Whereupon I firſt of all began to bethink my ſelf of making ſome part thereof publique. And having to that purpoſe adviſed with ſome of my more judicious friends, and being encouraged by ſome, and not diſcouraged by others, I did at laſt reſolve to attempt to publiſh and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t in print the ſame. And cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind that the Common Aſſurances and Conveyances of the Kingdome (being that whereupon the whole eſtates, and conſequently the livelihoods of very many depend) are matters of great importance and that concern moſt men; and that therefore the legall learning thereof muſt needs be of great and daily uſe. And conſidering withall the miſchief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing every where by the raſh adventures of ſundry ignorant men that meddle ſo much in theſe weighty matters, there being now almoſt in every Pariſh an unlearned, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Pragmaticall Atturney (not that I thinke them all to be ſuch) or a lawleſſe Scrivener, that may perhaps have ſome Law Books in their houſes, but never read more Law then is on the backſide of <hi>Littleton,</hi> or an ignorant Vicar, or it may be a Blackſmith, Carpenter, or Weaver, that have no
<pb facs="tcp:115677:4"/> more books of Law in their houſes, then they have Law in their heads, and yet as apt and able (if you will beleeve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) either to judge of a Conveyance, and by the rules of Law (of all which they are utterly ignorant) to determine of the ſtrength and goodneſſe of a title or eſtate already made, or to make a Conveyance to transferre the property of things from man to man, as the moſt learned and beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour of them all; and therefore undertake with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and diſpatch without any ſcruple any buſineſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever offered to their hands: wherein they deale with men in their eſtates, as many that are called Phyſitians (but in truth Empericks) deal with men in their bodies (an evill fit for the conſideration of a Parliament). How they come to this their ſuppoſed dexterity and skill is a wonder, except that ſaying be falſe, <hi>Namo naſcitur artifex.</hi> Either it muſt be born with them, or they muſt have it by education, or they muſt not have it at all. But if they will tell me they have good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, I will tell them that a good Conveyancer muſt be as well able to judge of the validity of the title, and primitive eſtate of him that is to convey (which a man can never doe without knowledge of the rules of Law, no more then a blind man can judge of colours) as to make a derivative e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and conveyance by a good preſident; for <hi>ſcire eſt per cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas ſcire,</hi> as the Philoſopher ſpeaks. And as well, for ought I know, may a man be an able Phyſitian by certain medicines onely that never read ſo much as the grounds of Phyſick, as ſuch men be able Conveyancers by their Preſidents only, that never read ſo much as the maximes of Law: <hi>Nullum medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum idem eſt in omnibus.</hi> For my part I muſt ingenuouſly profeſſe that I can ſcarce look into a Title or meddle with a conveyance of weight wherein I cannot make and move more doubts and queſtions, then I am able to reſolve and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and therefore theſe men have gotten the ſtart of mee much. And yet (much marvel it is to ſee) how theſe Empericks of the Law (if I may ſo call them) are ſought unto and made uſe of, and that not only in leſſer, but oft-times in greater and more weighty buſineſſes, and that without the aſſiſtance of any others more able and ſufficient; the which is not for lack of opportunity of finding more learned men in the Law, for there
<pb facs="tcp:115677:4"/> is a ſufficient ſtore of them in all places: nor doe thoſe that employ theſe Empericks of the Law always ſave (if they think it ſaved) mony hereby, for beſides the great miſchief which is oft-times done to themſelves by the unskilfulneſſe of theſe workmen, ſome of them by reaſon of their much cuſtome are grown more chargeable then an ordinary Counſellor, whoſe fee is certain and known. But of theſe Empericks of the Law and thoſe that make uſe of them, I might ſay as ſometimes our bleſſed Saviour ſaid, <hi>Let them alone the blind leaders of the blind.</hi> Howbeit being now called (as I conceive hereunto) I chuſe rather to admoniſh them and to tell the firſt ſort, That I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to be uſurpers upon, and intruders into other mens callings, and that they thruſt their ſickles into other mens har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, &amp; that they have not yet learned that rule of Divinity, <hi>To abide in the calling wherin they are called,</hi> but exerciſe themſelves in things too high for them; nor yet have they learned this, <hi>Ne ſutor ultra crepidam,</hi> Let not the Cobler goe beyond his laſt; nor have they learned that, <hi>In quo quiſque norit in hoc ſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat.</hi> And let me tell the latter ſort, That they heed not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough this ſaying, <hi>Caveat Emptor;</hi> nor beleeve that ſaying, <hi>Cuicunque in arte ſua credendum,</hi> that every man is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in his own art. But if you will ſay to me, That theſe men doe their work well, and their work doth ſucceed well: I will ſay to you, that the blinde man may happily hit the mark, and it may fall out that ſometimes they doe their work well, and it doth ſucceed well, but oft-times wofull experience ſheweth the contrary, and that many men have been much miſchieved every where by the ignorance of theſe men. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wiſh both ſorts of them to doubt more and to be well adviſed in theſe affairs, as the Law doth preſume every one will be; for therefore is it indeed that a Will hath a more favourable interpretation then a Deed, becauſe mens Wils are oft-times made in haſt, and it is preſumed men take who they can to make them; but men for the making of their Deeds are not put upon thoſe ſtraits, but they take adviſe of learned men therein. And the more to move men herein and to redreſſe the evill before diſcovered, I have herein ſet forth under certain generall Titles or Common Places, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Judgements, Statutes, Reſolutions, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb facs="tcp:115677:5"/> that doe contain or concern the learning of the Common Aſſurances of the Kingdome, ſo as I think I may truly ſay, under reformation, that there are few materiall things as touching this ſubject to be found any where diſperſed in the Volumes of the Law, but they are to be found ſomewhere herein, and that there ſhall not happen one Caſe of a hundred but a hundred to one the diligent Reader may here finde the Caſe it ſelf, or ſome Caſe that by good inference may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to it. Not that I would have men now to reſt upon this help, and be leſſe carefull and more careleſſe to take advice of the Lawyer then heretofore (for this is the diſeaſe I labour to cure), for howbeit it may be that hereby theſe matters are made in ſome meaſure conſpicuous, yet to ſay the very truth, beſides that the ſubject matter of Law is ſomewhat tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and too high for ordinary capacities, the manner of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Caſes is ſo conciſe, the diſtinctions and differences of Law are ſo many, that it is hard for any man not well read in the Laws in generall, to judge or make uſe of any part of them in particular, and rightly and fully to apprehend and apply the things herein ſet forth: and therefore I dare not adviſe men to reſt altogether hereupon, nor can I forbear to tell them it is very dangerous ſo to doe. But my aim and ends being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the uſes and commodities I expect and looke after from this work, is firſt of all, that ſuch men before ſpoken of, may ſee by the view of the infinite variety of Caſes, Points, and Queſtions, as touching theſe matters, diſcovering alſo ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by-ways wherein men converſant therein may walk, how much there goes to making up of an able Conveyancer, and that it is not ſo eaſie a matter to judge of a Title, give advice upon a Conveyance, and make theſe Common Aſſurances as men dream of, and that therefore men learn more to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect themſelves and others herein; and to theſe it may ſerve as a light in a dark place. Secondly, that by this the Lawyer and Student may in ſome meaſure readily finde together what he deſires touching theſe matters; and to him it may ſerve for a Table or Remembrancer. And laſtly, that every man may be the better able by the help hereof to underſtand, open, &amp; put his own caſe to his Lawyer, and to move more pertinent queſtions to him: and other uſes I would have no man to make
<pb facs="tcp:115677:5"/> of it. In the uſe of this work therefore I muſt give thee two Advertiſements or Caveats. Firſt, that if thou deſire to find any thing in particular therein contained, that thou read the whole Chapter, or at leaſt the whole Queſtion and Diviſion of the Chapter wherein that thing is contained. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thou doeſt not confidently build and rely upon any thing therein alone without advice from the learned Lawyer alſo, or at the leaſt without a ſerious and judicious peruſall of the Authorities &amp; Books themſelves to which thou art there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in referred: <hi>Melius eſt petere fontes quam ſectari rivulos.</hi> Some other things there are alſo herein inſerted as falling aptly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title, albeit it bee not altogether pertinent to the ſubject matter. And all theſe ſweet flowers of the Law grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſparſim</hi> in the great fields of the Volumes of the Common and Statute Laws have I thus painfully gathered, bound up, &amp; commended to thy charitable cenſure: no doubt but in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to graſp and take up ſo much, I have taken and bound up ſome graſſe withall, which I hope ſhall not offend. If ſo be that I finde it have a fragrant ſmell with thee, I ſhall think I have recompence enough for my pains. But if any man think me too preſumptuous to attempt this enterpriſe; let him know firſt, that there is nothing mine in it, but the method, (and that not mine neither altogether) the matter thereof being nothing elſe but the Judgements, Reſolutions, and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Judges of the Law in ſucceeding times: and then as I have not truſted my ſelfe, ſo they ſhall not truſt me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in theſe things. For I doe freely acknowledge mine own weakneſſe and want of judgement, and that I am the unmeeteſt and unworthieſt of all men to undertake ſuch a work, not one of a thouſand, but the meaneſt of ten thouſand. And this I have done is a poor ſomething ſufficient onely to give them that are more learned occaſion to doe ſomething more exactly in this kind. If any man diſlike the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of it in the Engliſh tongue, and think perhaps it may make the Law to be the more deſpiſed, and the Practitioner of the Law the leſſe regarded and uſed: I doe wonder at the diſlike of ſuch a man; for to me there appears no more reaſon why to keep the Lawes in an unknown languange that they may be kept from the knowledge of the people, then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb facs="tcp:115677:6"/> have to keep the Scriptures and their prayers in a language unknown to the people; theſe being the Laws by which the people are to be governed, and the Law being the beſt inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Subject. The wiſdome of the Parliament hath thought to commend all the Statute Laws to the people in Engliſh, and to appoint that the pleadings ſhould be in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. And have we not many Books of Law in Engliſh alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as <hi>Littletons Tenures, Doctor</hi> and <hi>Student, Finches</hi> Law, Juſtice <hi>Dodridge</hi> Treatiſes, <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Littleton,</hi> the <hi>Womans Lawyer,</hi> and many others? and are not theſe uſefull and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table? And beſides the greateſt part of the proceedings in Chancery (the Court of greateſt employment within the Kingdome) are in Engliſh. And if it be meet any part of the Law be in the native tongue, it ſhould ſeeme it is meet this part ſhould be ſo, becauſe it concerneth ſo many men, and them alſo ſo much, that they may ſee and underſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in their own Evidences. And therefore as we have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Deeds from Latine to Engliſh, ſo let us alſo turne ſome of the Law touching theſe Deeds out of French into Engliſh. <hi>Bonum quo communius eo melius.</hi> And I ſee no more reaſon why in Law more then in Phyſick the diſcovery of the Art ſhould make the Art or Artiſt the leſſe regarded. But (under correction) I ſhould rather think that it will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make them both the more eſteemed as a jewell whoſe properties are known, and that it will make them the more, and other men we have before ſpoken of the leſſe to be uſed and employed in their affairs, for the more men know, the leſſe they think they know, and the more they doubt, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moves men to be ſo bold and confident in theſe matters as their ignorance, according to the Proverb, <hi>Who ſo bold as blind Bayard?</hi> And for further anſwer to this, I wiſh men to ſee the Preface to the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Littleton.</hi> And if any man have any thing elſe to object and except (for ſome there are that will neither put forth their own ſtrength to doe good, nor bear with others that doe ſo) I wiſh them to undertake the ſame ſubject, and to perfect and ſupply my defects.

Thoſe that are made by matter of Record alſo are made either by matter of Record of a more high nature and extraordinary way, or by matter of Record of a more low nature and ordinary way. Thoſe Aſſurances that are made by matter of Record of a more high nature are ſuch as are made by Act of Parliament, of which we intend not to treat at all, neither doe we intend to meddle with thoſe Aſſurances that are made by the King unto his Subjects, as being matters more tranſcendent and intricate; but thoſe we intend to treat of are onely the common Aſſurances or Conveyances that are made between Subject and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and are of ordinary and daily uſe for the transferring of the property of lands, tenements and hereditaments from one man to another. And of theſe there are obſerved to bee tenne kinds, two whereof are made by matter of Record, as a Fine, which is ſaid to be a feoffment of Record, and a common recovery, which is in the nature alſo of a feoffement of Record: and the reſt are by matter of Deed, as Firſt, by feoffement.

And ſometimes it is taken for an Income or a ſumme of money paid at the entrance of a tenant into his land. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken for a finall agreement or conveyance upon Record for the ſetling and ſecuring of lands and tenements. And in this ſenſe it is taken here; and ſo it is defined by ſome to be, An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement in the Kings Court of the land or other thing to bee his right that doth complain. And by others, A Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween parties &amp; recorded by the Juſtices. And by others, A friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reall and finall agreement amongſt parties concerning any land or rent or other thing whereof any ſuit or writ is hanging bteween them in any Court. And by others more fully, An inſtrument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of an agreement concerning lands, tenements or hereditaments, duly made by the Kings licenſe and knowledged by the parties to the ſame, upon a writ of covenant, writ of right, or ſuch like, before the Juſtices of the Common Pleas or others thereunto authoriſed, and ingroſſed of Record in the ſame Court, to end all controverſies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both between themſelves which be parties and privies to the ſame, and al ſtrangers not ſuing or claiming in due time. And in every Fine there is a ſuit ſuppoſed, wherein the party that is to have the thing is called the Plaintiffe, &amp; ſometimes alſo in another reſpect the conuſee <note place="margin">Gonuſee or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſee.

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:115677:8"/> becauſe it gives a man the fruit or effect of his ſuit. And to this day therefore a writ doth alwaies goe forth before a fine can be levyed, and this is now one of the common Aſſurances of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>There are five eſſentiall parts of a Fine. Firſt, the originall writ <note place="margin">The parts of it.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Co. 5. 38. 43. Stat. 5 H. 4 ch. 14.</note> taken out againſt the conuſor, for without this a fine cannot be levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Secondly, the Kings licenſe for the levying of the fine, and for this the King is to have a fine or ſumme of money, which is called Kings ſilver, for this is properly that money which is due to the King, <note place="margin">Kings ſilver. Quid.</note> in the Court of Common Pleas, in reſpect of a licenſe there granted to any man for paſſing a fine. And this is part of the revenues of the Crown. Thirdly, the Conuſance or Concord it ſelfe which is the very agreement between the parties that intend the levying of the <note place="margin">Concord Quid.</note> fine how and in what manner the thing ſhall paſſe, and doth begin thus; <hi>Et eſt Concordia talis, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the foundation or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the fine, for if upon this the Kings ſilver be entred, albeit the Conuſor die afterwards, yet the fine is good, and the note or foot of the fine are but abſtracts out of this. Fourthly, the note of the <note place="margin">Note of the Fine. <hi>Quid.</hi>
                  </note> fine, which is an abſtract of the originall Contract or Concord, and doth beginne thus. <hi>Inter A. querentem et B. et C. deforcientes, &amp;c.</hi> Fifthly, the foot of the fine, which doth begin thus. <hi>Haec eſt finalis Concordia, &amp;c.</hi> and containeth all the matter, the day, yeere, and <note place="margin">Foot of the Fine. <hi>Quid.</hi>
                  </note> place, and before what Juſtices it was levied, which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Foot of the fine becauſe it is the laſt part of it, and when this is done all is done. And of this there are indentures made by the Chirographer and delivered to the party to whom the Conuſance is <note place="margin">F. N. B. 147. a. Co. 5. 39.</note> made, which is called the Ingroſſing of a fine, for then a fine is ſaid <note place="margin">Ingroſſing of the Fine. <hi>Quid.</hi>
                  </note> to be ingroſſed when the Chirographer makes the indentures of the fine, and doth deliver them to the party to whom the Conuſance is made.</p>
               <p>A Fine is either without Proclamations, which is alſo called a fine <note place="margin">Quotuplex.</note> at the common law, and this is ſuch a fine as is levyed after ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Weſt.

But if at the time of levying of ſuch an executory fine the party unto whom the eſtate is limited be in poſſeſſion of the lands paſſed, he ſhall not need any writ of execution to put him in poſſeſſion, for then the fine will enure by way of extinguiſhment of right, and doth not alter the eſtate or poſſeſſion of the Cogniſee, however perchance it doth better it. The fine <hi>Sur conuſance de droit tantum,</hi> alſo doth ſerve ſometimes to make a ſurrender, and then it is therein recited that the Conuſor hath an eſtate for life, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſee the reverſion: and ſometimes it doth ſerve to grant a Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then the particular eſtate is recited to be in another, and that the Conuſor willeth that the other ſhall have the reverſion, or that the land ſhall remain to the other after the particular eſtate ſpent: a fine alſo is either ſingle, which is ſuch a fine by which an eſtate is granted to the Cogniſee and nothing granted or rendred back again to the Cogniſor by the Cogniſee. Or it is double, which is ſuch a fine as doth contain a grant, and render back again either of the land
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115677:9"/> it ſelfe, or of ſome rent, common, or other thing out of it to the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſor for ſome eſtate, limiting thereby many times remainders to ſtrangers which be not named in the writ of covenant, which alſo is ſometimes with reſervation of rent, clauſe of diſtreſſe, and grant of the ſame over.</p>
               <p>The manner and order of ſuing out or levying of a fine is thus. <note place="margin">Experientia.

                  <hi>Meſne, Warrantia cartae, de conſuetudinibus et ſervitiis,</hi> or any writ of right (for upon theſe or any other writ whereby land is demanded or may be recovered, a fine may bee levyed) but the moſt uſuall writ whereupon a fine is levyed is a writ of covenant. And whiles this writ is depending, for howſoever it be the common practiſe to take out a <hi>Dedimus poteſtatem,</hi> and have the conuſance of a fine before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny originall writ be ſued forth, yet the originall writ is alwaies ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in law to precede the <hi>Dedimus poteſtatem,</hi> and therefore doth and muſt evermore beare <hi>Teſte</hi> before it, or elſe it is erroneous. After the originall writ ſued forth, thre is a <hi>Precipe,</hi> which is the tituling of the writ whereupon the fine is levyed, and the concord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the parties, both which are fairly written (and that moſt commonly in parchment:) after this, the partie or parties that is or are to knowledge and levy the fine is or are to come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before him or them that have power to take the ſame conuſance; who are to take notice of the perſons, that if there be any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath a husband amongſt the conuſors in the fine, they doe examine her whether ſhe be willing and doe it freely without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of her husband. After this, all the parties that are to levy the fine are to declare themſelves before the Judges or Commiſſioners (having power to take the ſame conuſance) to be willing to paſſe their right in the lands according to the agreement, and to ſubſcribe their names or markes to the concord: and if it be taken by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Dedimus poteſtatem,</hi> it is to be returned and certifyed under the hands and Seales of the Commiſſioners into the Court of Common Pleas, that it may be there recorded and finiſhed. And there the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conuſee is firſt to compound with the King for his licenſe, for which he is to pay the Kings ſilver, and thereof he is to have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on the back of his writ of Covenant, and then he is to have it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled by the <hi>Cuſtos brevium,</hi> and upon this roll the Proclamations are to be indorſed: after this, it is to be brought to the Chirogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who is firſt to make that Note thereof that is called the Note of the fine: and hereupon if it be a Remainder, Reverſion, Rent or Seigniorie whereof the fine is levyed the writ of <hi>Quid juris clamat, Per quae ſervitia, Quem redditum reddit,</hi> as the caſe requireth, muſt be ſued forth. And after this, the Chirographer is to enter the fine of record to ingroſſe it, and to make and to deliver the Indentures thereof unto the Conuſee, and if it be a fine with Proclamations, it is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115677:10"/> to be proclaimed openly in the Court of Common Pleas once every one of the four termes next after the ingroſſing of it, (and it was to be proclaimed within the County where the land did lye at every aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſes and ſeſſions the next yeere after the ingroſſing of it, but this it ſeemes is not neceſſary now) and the next terme after the ingroſſing of it the contents thereof are to be recorded in a Table (made for that purpoſe) to be ſet up in the court of Common Pleas at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter in an open place all the terme time, and ſo alſo at every aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the fine may alſo be inrolled and exemplifyed.</p>

And yet if <hi>A.</hi> tenant in taile, and <hi>N.</hi> doe by fine acknowledge the land to be the right of a ſtranger, as that, &amp;c. and then the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is cogniſee doth grant and render the land again to <hi>N.</hi> for life, or yeers with clauſe of diſtreſſe, &amp;c. and then grant and render the reverſion to the tenant in taile, this is a good fine, and will barre the iſſue in taile alſo, and will likewiſe paſſe the rent and the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the tenant in taile. So if a Stranger that hath nothing in the land levy a fine <hi>Sur cogniſance de droit come ceo que il ad, &amp;c.</hi> To him in remainder in taile depending upon an eſtate for life, and the cogniſee by the ſame fine render to the cogniſor for tenne yeers to begin at Michaelmas following and dieth, and all the proclamations are made after his death, and the tenant for life dyeth after the time the leaſe is to begin; this is a good fine, and ſo a good leaſe to barre the iſſue in taile.</p>

               <p>For a more full underſtanding of which Statutes and this matter, theſe things in generall muſt firſt be obſerved. 1. That the perſons to be barred by a fine are, 1 Parties. 2 Privies. 3 Eſtrangers. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties if they be of the age of 21. years, are bound for ever by the fine, and ſhall have no time to claim to preſerve their right. The privies alſo, being heires and executors to the parties and voyd of impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the time of the fine levied, or not, if they claim by the ſame title that their Anceſtor had that levied the fine, are barred for ever by the fine, and ſhall have no time to claime to preſerve their right. <note n="†" place="margin">Dyer 3. paſche, 7. Jac. B.

And here note, <note n="*" place="margin">Trin. 21 Jac. Com. B. Curia in in Will. Godfreys caſe.</note> that he that is a privie within the intent of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. is an heire within the Statute of 32 <hi>H. 8. Et ſic è converſo.</hi> And that privies or heires in eſtate and bloud, as he that is heire to whom the land doth or ſhould deſcend are within theſe Statutes, and ſhall be barred by the fine of their Anceſtor of that land. And ſo alſo ſhall privies in eſtate that are not privies in bloud, as where one hath land in burrow Engliſh, and levie a fine of it, hereby the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſonne is barred. So if one bee tenant in taile to him and the heires females of his body, and he levie a fine, having a ſonne and daughter, hereby the iſſue female is barred, and yet ſhe is not the heire of his bloud. But he that is privie in bloud only, and not in eſtate alſo, is not within theſe Statutes, neither ſhall he be barred by the fine, and therefore if lands be given to a man, and the heires fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males of his body, and he hath a ſonne and a daughter, and the ſon levie a fine and die without iſſue, this is no barre to the daughter, for howſoever ſhe be heire of his bloud, yet ſhe is not heire to the eſtate, nor ſhall need to make her conveyance to it by him. The ſtrangers that are to be concluded by the fine, are either, 1. Such as have preſent right and no impediment, and theſe are barred within
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115677:18"/> five yeares if they make not their claime within five yeares after the Proclamations. 2. Such as have preſent right, but have impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of infancy, &amp;c. and theſe are barred if they doe not make their claime within five yeares after the impediment removed. 3. Such as have no preſent but future right upon cauſe precedent, and they are either without impediment, and then they are barred if they claime not within five yeares after their right doth acrew; or they have impediments, and then they are barred if they claime not within five yeares after the impediment removed. 4. Such as have neither preſent nor future right at the time of the levying of the fine by reaſon of any matter before the fine, but whoſe right grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth either entirely after, or partly before, and partly after the fine, and theſe are not barred at all by the fine, but they may make their claime, &amp;c. when they will. And parties, privies, and ſtrangers to <note place="margin">Plow. 538. 337, 375, 378.</note> fines that are barred thereby, are ſuch as have naturall capacities or civill, for both theſe are barred. And therefore it is held, if ſuch a Corporation as hath an abſolute eſtate and authority of his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo as he may maintaine a writ of right thereof, as Major and Communalty, Deane and Chapter, &amp;c. levie a fine of their lands, they and their ſucceſſors are barred preſently, but if a Biſhop, Deane, or Prebend, without aſſent of the Deane and Chapter, or a Parſon and Vicar without aſſent of the Patron and Ordinary had levied a fine, this would not have barred the ſucceſſor; neither will it barre now with their aſſent, for they are reſtrained by divers Statutes. So alſo ſuch perſons are barred by the fines that are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied by others if they make not their claime in time, as if one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſe a Corporation aggregate of land belonging to their Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and after levie a fine of it with Proclamations, and they doe not make their claime, &amp;c. within five years, hereby they are barred. 2.

So if the tenant of the land, out of which I have a Rent or Common, &amp;c. levie a fine of the land, this ſhall not barre me of my Rent or Common, for I am ſtill in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this in the judgement of the Law.

In like manner if there be tenant for life, the remainder for life, the remainder in fee, and the firſt tenant for life alien, and the alienee levie a fine with Proclamations, and the ſecond tenant for life claim, or enter, &amp;c. this doth make void the fine both againſt him, and againſt him in remainder alſo: for it is a rule, That any one that hath any eſtate in poſſeſſion or reverſion which will be barred by the fine when it is levied, may make a claime or entrie to prevent the bar of the fine. As tenant for his own, or for anothers life, tenant for years, he in reverſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder after an eſtate for life or years, a Copyholder, or the Lord, a Gardian in nature, or nurture, may avoyd a fine. And this they may do for themſelves and others, &amp; for others without authority prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or aſſent ſubſequent, and the claim of one of them in this caſe ſhall availe the other. And by authority alſo any other man may make a claim, entry &amp;c. in this caſe for him that hath right, and ſo he may doe alſo without any authority precedent, if the party for whom he doth it doe afterwards agree and aſſent unto it. But a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115677:25"/> ſtranger of his owne head (unleſſe perhaps it bee for an Infant) cannot make ſuch a claime or entry to prevent the barre of a fine, except hee that hath the right doe give him authority before it be done ſo to doe, or doe agree to it after it is done. And therefore if a ſtranger of his owne head will make an entry or claime into land whereof a fine is levied whereunto I have right, and he doe it to my uſe, and I doe not agree to it within the 5. yeares, this entrie or claime will not avoid the fine. And yet it was held by Juſt. <hi>Dodridge, M. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Car. B.

And the words of the Indenture are the words of either party. And albeit they be ſpoken as the words of the one party only, yet they are not his words alone but may be applyed to the other party if they doe more properly belong to him: for every word that is doubtfull ſhall be applied and expounded to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him to whom they will beſt agree according to the intent of the parties; and they ſhall not be taken more ſtrongly againſt one or beneficially for the other as the words of a deed Poll ſhall. <note n="*" place="margin">11 H. 7. 22. per Brian.</note> If therefore <hi>A</hi> by indenture enfeoffe <hi>B</hi> upon condition and then doth enter for the condition broken; in this caſe it hath been held that <hi>A</hi> in his pleading may ſhew forth the deed that he himſelfe ſealed, and that this is ſufficient. And therefore alſo it is thought that an Indenture made in the firſt Perſon is as good in Law as an Indenture made in the third Perſon when both parties <note place="margin">Lit. Sect. 373.</note>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:115677:33"/> have to this put to their Seales, for if in an Indenture made in the third Perſon or in the firſt perſon mention be made that the grantor only hath put to his Seale and not the grantee, then is the indenture only the deed of the grantor, but when mention is made that the grantee alſo hath put his Seale to the indenture, it ſhall be ſaid to be the deed of them both.</p>
               <p>And although both parts of the indenture are but as one part, yet the deed of the grantor is as the Principall and the other is <note place="margin">Finches Law 109.</note> not but a Counter-part. And therefore if the leſſor only ſeale and not the leſſee, yet it is as good as if both had ſealed, and if there be any difference between the Parts, the Counter-parts ſhall be made to agree with the principall, and it ſhall be deemed the miſpriſion of the Clarke.</p>
               <p>This deed is the ſtrongeſt kind of deed of the two, for this <note place="margin">Eſtoppell.</note>

But it is otherwiſe of a deed poll, for this is commonly but of one part which is ſealed by the feoffor, leſſor, &amp;c. only. And this ſhall be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be the ſole deed of the feoffor, leſſor &amp;c. and the words therein contained ſhall be ſaid to be his words and ſhall bind him only and be expounded altogether in advantage of the feoffee, leſſee &amp;c. and againſt the feoffor, leſſor &amp;c. and this doth not worke any Eſtoppell againſt either party. But if a deed be inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or poll, and there be therein reciprocall Covenants between <note place="margin">Trin. 38 El. Co. B. per Curiam.

And this is called the legall part, the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof belongeth to the Judges of the Law. 2. That there <note place="margin">Perk.

And theſe laſt things being matters of fact are to be tryed by Jurors. 6. That the ground, foundation, end, and purpoſe of making the <note place="margin">See infra.</note> deed be good and not againſt the Law. Otherwiſe in moſt of theſe caſes the deed is voyd <hi>ab initio.</hi> Alſo in ſome caſes to perfect the contract and make the conveyance of the thing intended to be paſſed thereby good, ſome other ceremonies or comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are requiſite, as Inrollment, Livery of Seiſin, Atturnement, otherwiſe the deed in part at leaſt becommeth fruitleſſe and vaine. For a deed may be void, either for that the writting is not in parchment or paper; or being ſo is not legally and formally drawn; or being ſo, there doth want a perſon able to give, or make, or capable to have, or take, or a thing to be contracted for; or if ſo, for that it is not duely ſealed and delivered; or if ſo, for that it is not truly read at the time of the ſealing and delivery; or if ſo, for that it is made void by ſome ſpeciall law, as being made upon an uſurious Contract, by dureſſe, or the like. Or it may at leaſt in part loſe his force afterwards by neglect of inrollment, Livery of Seiſin, or Atturnement in caſes where theſe things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
               <p>Every deed well made muſt be written. <hi>i.</hi> The agreement <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 118. Co. ſuper Lit. 171.</note> muſt be all written before the ſealing and delivery of it: for if a <note place="margin">1. In reſpect of the writing of it.</note> man ſeale and deliver an empty peece of paper or parchment, albeit he doe therewithall give commandement that an obligation or other matter ſhall be written in it, and this be done accordingly, yet this is no good deed. 2. This writing muſt be in paper or <note place="margin">2] Co. ſuper Lit. 229. F. N. B. 122. Lit. 27 H. 6. 9.</note> parchment, for if an agreement be written on a peece of wood, linnen, the barke of a tree, a ſtone, or the like, and this be ſealed and delivered; this is no good deed. <note n="b" place="margin">Co. 2. 3.</note> But it may be written in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115677:34"/> any language, or in any hand. And therefore it is held that a deed written in French or Latine, and in Text, Court, or Roman hand, is as good as a deed written in Engliſh and in a Secretary hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Perk. Sect. 123.</note> And albeit the writing be beſides the lines, or the lines be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten crooked, yet this will not hurt the deed. <note n="d" place="margin">Perk. Sect. 155. Co. ſuper Lit. 225.</note> And if there be any Alteration, raſure, or enterlining made in any part of the deed before the delivery of it; this will not hurt the deed. But in ſuch caſes it is policy to make a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of it upon the backe of the deed, and to give the witneſſes notice of it; for otherwiſe if it be in any place materiall, as in the name of the grantor, grantee, in the limiting of the eſtate, or the like, and eſpecially if it be in a deed poll, the deed is greatly ſuſpicious. 3. The matter written <note place="margin">3] Co. ſuper Lit. 225.</note> muſt be legall and orderly for manner and matter. <hi>i.</hi> There muſt be words ſufficient to ſet forth the agreement and bind the parties, for a deed may be void and loſe his virtue in all or part for repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, incertainty, and divers other matters (whereof ſee in expoſition of Deeds <hi>infra.)</hi> But it is not materiall whether the deed be in the <note place="margin">Fitz. Fait &amp; feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 5 Dier 6.</note> Firſt, or in the Third perſon ſo as the words be aptly applyed. For if a deed Poll be in the Third perſon <hi>viz. Quod preſens ſcriptum teſtatur &amp;c. quod idem</hi> A <hi>dedit &amp; tradidit &amp;c.</hi> Or an obligation be in the Third perſon, <hi>viz.

So if the words of a deed indented run in the Firſt perſon, it is as good as if it were in the Third perſon. Neither is it neceſſary that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <note place="margin">Co. 5. 121. 10. 133. See Oblig.

And a deed is good albeit theſe <note place="margin">Co. 2. 5. Dier. 19. Kelw. 70.</note> words in the cloſe thereof <hi>In cujus rei teſtimonium Sigillum meum appoſui</hi> be omitted, and albeit there be no mention made in the ſame that the deed was ſealed and delivered ſo as in truth it be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſealed and delivered and the ſealing and delivery can be proved. <note place="margin">Co. 2. 5. 5. 117 Dier 28. Perk. Sect. 120. Co. ſuper Lit. 6.</note> Alſo a deed is good albeit it mention no time or place of date or making, or have a falſe date. <hi>i.</hi> be dated at one time and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at another, and albeit it have an impoſſible date, as the 30 of <hi>February</hi> or the like, for anciently untill the time of <hi>E.</hi> 2. and <hi>E.</hi> 3. the deeds had no date becauſe the Law was then held to be that if a deed were dated before the time of memory it was not pleadable except it were of Record but it might have been given in evidence. But he that doth plead ſuch a deed without any date, or with ſuch an impoſſible date muſt ſet forth the time when it was delivered.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115677:35"/>
               <p>The ſecond thing required in every well made deed is, That the <note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the perſons parties thereunto and matter therein.</note> perſon making it be able to give, grant, make, or doe the thing <note place="margin">Co. 11. 73. Plow. 555. Perk. Sect. 1. 119. See Grant. infra. Numb. 4. Feoffements infra Numb. 12.</note> contained in it; that the perſon to whom it is made be capable of the thing to be given, granted, made or done thereby, for if it be made by, or to any ſuch perſons as are diſabled, as Infants, Aliens, women Covert, Perſons attainted of Treaſon or Felony, Idiots, and ſuch like, it will be void in all or part. But any perſon naturall male or female, or politique, as ſole Corporations, or Corpotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aggregate of many, Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall, not diſabled by law may give or take by deed. Alſo there muſt be ſome matter whereabout the contract may be converſant. It is therefore ſaid that in every grant there muſt be grantor, grantee, and a thing to be granted and in every obligation an obligor, obligee, and thing to which the obligor is bound, and ſo of Feoffements and other deeds.</p>
               <p>The third thing required in every well made deed is, That if the <note place="margin">Co. 2. 9. 3. 11. 27. 14 H. 8. 25.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In reſpect of the reading of it.</note> party that is to ſeale it be a blind or an illiterate man, and deſire to heare it read that it be ſo, for if ſuch a man be to ſeale a deed, and he deſire to heare it, or to heare the contents of it read or declared to him firſt, and it be not done, and he afterwards ſeale and deliver it; this is no good deed. So if upon or without any ſuch requeſt made by him that is to ſeale and deliver it, the partie himſelfe to whom it is made, or a ſtranger ſhall read the deed, or declare the contents thereof falſly and otherwiſe then in truth it is; the deed will be voyd at leaſt for ſo much as is ſo miſread or miſdeclared. But if the party himſelfe that is to ſeale and deliver it before the ſealing and delivery thereof cauſe another that is a ſtranger covinouſly to read it, or to declare the contents thereof falſly to him, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then it is, of purpoſe to make the deed voyd; this will not hurt the deed. So if the party that is to ſeale the deed can read himſelfe and doth not, or being an illiterate or a blind man doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to heare the deed read, or the contents thereof declared; in theſe caſes albeit the deed be contrary to his mind, yet is it good and unavoydable.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing required in every well made deed is, that it be <note place="margin">4. In reſpect of the ſealing of it.</note> ſealed: But this ſealing of deeds in times paſt was not uſed, for the <note place="margin">Termes of the Law. Fait. Co. fuper Lit. 225. Co. 2. 4. 5. Perk. Sect. 129.</note> Saxons uſed only to ſubſcribe their names and to adde the ſigne of the Croſſe, and to ſet downe a great number of witneſſes. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Normans brought in with them the ſealing of deeds but by degrees, for firſt the Kings and a few of the Nobility uſed it, and to ſeale with their Seales of Arms, afterwards all the Nobility uſed it, and then the Gentlemen, and about the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. all men began to uſe ſealing of deeds, which hath been continued ever ſithence, ſo that now it is of neceſſity, in ſo much that if a deed be never ſo well written before and delivered afterwards, yet if it be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115677:35"/> not ſealed between the writing and delivery, it is not a good deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if a ſtranger ſeale it by the allowance or commandement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 130. 131. 134</note> or agreement ſubſequent of him that is to ſeale it before the delivery of it, it is as well as if the party to the deed did ſeale it himſelfe. And therefore if another man ſeale a deed of mine, and I take it up after it is ſealed and deliver it as my deed; this is ſaid to be a good agreement to, and allowance of the ſealing, and ſo a good deed. And if the party ſeale the deed with any Seale beſides <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 130. 131. 132</note> his own, or with a ſtick or any ſuch like thing which doth make a print, it is good. And although it be a Corporation that doth make the deed, yet they may ſeale with any other ſeale beſides their common Seale and the deed never the worſe. And if there be 20. to ſeale one deed, and they ſeale all upon one peece of wax <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 134.</note> and with one Seale, yet if they make diſtinct and ſeverall prints; this is a very ſufficient ſealing and the deed is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing required in every well made deed is, That there <note place="margin">5. In reſpect of the delivery of it. And what ſhall be ſaid a good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or not. 1. In reſpect of the perſon that doth make it.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Co. 2. 4. 5. Perk. Sect. 137. 9 H. 6. 37.</note> be a delivery of it. And for this it muſt be known, that delivery is either actuall. <hi>i.</hi> by doing ſomething and ſaying nothing, or elſe Verball. <hi>i.</hi> by ſaying ſomething and doing nothing, or it may be by both, And either of theſe may make a good delivery &amp; a perfect deed. But by one or both of theſe it muſt be made, for otherwiſe albeit it be never ſo well ſealed and written, yet is the deed of no force. And though the party to whom it is made take it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or hap to get it into his hands, yet will it do him no good nor him that made it any hurt untill it be delivered. And a deed may <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 137. 9 H. 6. 37. Co. 11. 28. 3. 35. 47 E. 3. 3.</note> be delivered by the party himſelfe that doth make it, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his appointment or authority precedent or aſſent or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement ſubſequent, for <hi>omnis ratihibitio mandato aequiperatun,</hi> And when it is delivered by another that hath a good authority and doth purſue it, it is as good a deed as if it were delivered by the party himſelfe: but if he doe not purſue his authority then it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. And therefore if a deed or the contents thereof be read or declared to a man that is to ſeale him; and he (being illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) doth deliver him to a ſtranger, and bid him examine him, and if it be ſo as it was read to him, then to deliver him as his deed, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to redeliver him to him againe that made it; in this caſe if the deed be in truth, otherwiſe then it was read, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he to whom it was delivered doth deliver him to him, to whom it is made, this delivery ſhall not not availe, neither is the deed by this delivery become a good deed. <note place="margin">Dyer 167.

               </p>
               <p>And ſo alſo a deed may be delivered to the party himſelf to whom it is made or to any other by ſufficient authority from him: or it <note place="margin">2. In reſpect of him to whom it is made.</note> may be delivered to any ſtranger for and in the behalfe, &amp; to the uſe of him to whom it is made without authority. But if it be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115677:36"/> to a ſtranger without any ſuch declaration, intention or intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unleſſe it be in caſe where it is delivered as an eſcrow, it ſeems this is not a ſufficient delivery. And yet if an Obligation be made to the uſe of a third perſon expreſſed by the deed, and the obligor <note place="margin">Dyer 192.</note> deliver it to him to whoſe uſe it is made; this is ſaid to be a good delivery. And albeit it be delivered before or after the day of the <note place="margin">3 In reſpect of the time. 4 In reſpect of the manner and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of delivery.</note> date of it, yet it is good enough: but if it be delivered before it be <note place="margin">Co. 2. 4. Plow. 492.</note> ſealed it is nothing worth. And where it is delivered before the date, yet in the pleading of it it muſt not be ſo ſet forth.</p>
               <p>If I have ſealed my deed, and after I deliver it to him to whom <note place="margin">Co. 9. 137. Dyer 192. 167. Co. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lit. 36. 49. 35. Aſſ. pl. 6.</note> it is made, or to ſome other by his appointment and ſay nothing, this is a good delivery: So if I take the deed in my hand and uſe theſe or the like words; Here take him, or This will ſerve, or I deliver this as my deed, or I deliver him you; theſe are deliveries. So if I make a deed of land to another, and being upon the Land I deliver the deed to him in the name of Seiſin of the Land; this is a good delivery. So if the deed be ſealed and lying in a window, or on a Table, and I uſe theſe or the like words, There he is, take it as my deed; this is a good delivery and doth perfect the deed, for as a deed may be delivered by words without deeds, ſo may it alſo be delivered by deeds without words. But if a man ſeale and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note place="margin">Adjudged Trin. 37. El. B. R.</note> before a Major or other Officer appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a writing provided for a Statute ora recogniſance, this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment before ſuch an Officer ſhall not amount to a delivery of the deed ſo as to make it a good obligation if it happen not to be a good Statute or Recogniſance.</p>
               <p>The delivery of a deed as an Eſcrow is ſaid to be where one doth <note place="margin">19 H. 8. Kelw. 88. 14 H. 8. 22. 14 H. 6. 42. Perk. Sect. 141. 140. 142. 138. 143. 144. Fits Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; Fait. 4. 13. 15. Co. 9. 137. ſuper Lit. 48. 36.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">As an Eſcrow. <hi>Quid.</hi>
                  </note> make and ſeale a deed and deliver it unto a ſtranger untill cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conditions be performed, and then to be delivered to him to whom the deed is made to take effect as his deed. And ſo a man may deliver a deed, and ſuch a delivery is good. But in this caſe two cautions muſt be heeded. 1. That the form of words uſed in the delivery of a deed in this manner be apt and proper. 2. That the deed be delivered to one that is a ſtranger to it, and not to the party himſelfe to whom it is made. The words therefore that are uſed in the delivery muſt be after this manner. I deliver this to you as an eſcrow to deliver to the party as my deed upon condition that he doe deliver you 20l. for me, or upon condition that he deliver up the old bond he hath of mine for the ſame mony, or as the caſe is. Or elſe it muſt be thus. I deliver this as an Eſcrow to you to keep untill ſuch a day &amp;c. upon condition that if before this day he to whom the Eſcrow is made ſhall pay to me 10l. or give to me a horſe, or infeoffe me of the Manor of Dale, (or perform any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) that then you ſhall deliver this Eſcrow to him as my deed. For if when I ſhall deliver the deed to the ſtranger, I ſhall uſe theſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115677:36"/> or the like words. I deliver this to you as my deed, and that you ſhall deliver it to the party upon certain conditions: Or, I deliver this to you as my deed to deliver to him to whom it is made when he comes to London, in theſe caſes the deed doth take effect preſently and the party is not bound to perform any of the conditions. So it muſt bee delivered to a ſtranger, for if I ſeale my deed and deliver it to the party himſelfe to whom it is made as an Eſcrow upon certaine conditions &amp;c. in this caſe let the form of words be what it will, the delivery is abſolute, and the deed ſhall take effect as his deed preſently, and the party is not bound to perform the conditions; for, <hi>In traditionibus Charta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum non quod dictum ſed quod factum eſt inſpicitur.</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Fitz. Faits &amp; Feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments 13.</note> But in the firſt caſes before where the deed is delivered to a ſtranger and apt words are uſed in the delivery thereof, it is of no more force untill the conditions be performed then if I had made it and layd it by me and not delivered it at all, and therefore in that caſe albeit the party get it into his hands before the conditions be performed, yet he can make no uſe of it at all, neither will it do him any good. <note n="f" place="margin">Idem.</note> But when the conditions are performed and the deed is delivered over, then the deed ſhall take as much effect as if it were delivered immediately to the party to whom it is made, <note n="g" place="margin">Co. 3. 35.</note> and no act of God or man can hinder or prevent this effect then if the party that doth make it be not at the time of making thereof diſabled to make it. He therefore that is truſted with the keeping and delivery of ſuch a writing ought not to deliver it before the conditions be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and when the conditions be performed he ought not to keep it but to deliver it to the party. For it may be made a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the deed be perfect before he hath delivered it over to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to the authority given him. Howbeit it ſeems the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery <note place="margin">Co. 5. 84. 3. 36.</note> is good, for it is ſaid in this caſe that if either of the parties to the deed dye before the conditions be performed, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be after performed, that the deed is good, for there was <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio inchoata</hi> in the life time of the parties, <hi>&amp; poſtea conſummata exiſtens</hi> by the performance of the conditions it taketh his effect by the firſt delivery without any new or ſecond delivery, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond delivery is but the execution and conſummation of the firſt delivery. And therefore if an Infant, or woman covert deliver a <note place="margin">Co. 3. 35. 36.</note> deed as an Eſcow to a ſtranger, and before the conditions are performed the Infant is become of full age, or the woman is become ſole, yet the deed in theſe caſes is not become good. And yet if a diſſeiſee make a deed purporting a leaſe for years, and deliver it to a ſtranger out of the land as an Eſcrow, and bid him enter into the land, and deliver it as his deed, and he do ſo, this is a good deed, and a good leaſe, ſo that to ſome purpoſes it hath relation to the time <note place="margin">Relation.</note>

               <p>In caſe where a deed is meerly void and doth take no effect by his firſt delivery, as where a woman covert doth ſeale and deliver <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 154. 11 H. 6. 27.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Double Delivery.</note> a deed, or the like, and ſhe after being ſole after her husbands death doth deliver the deed again, in this caſe the deed is become good. So where a deed originally good doth becom void by matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> as by breaking the Seale or the like, if the party to the deed ſeale and deliver it again; by this means the deed is become good again. But regularly there may not be two deliveries of a deed, for where the firſt delivery doth take any effect at all, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond delivery is void.</p>

So if one threaten me to take away my goods, burn or break my houſe, enter upon my land, kill or wound my father, or mother, brother, or ſiſter, or friend, or doe impriſon any of them, and thereupon I ſeale a deed; this is good and ſhall bind me. So if one diſtraine my beaſts to compell me to ſeale a deed and will not deliver them unleſſe I do ſo, and threaten me that if I take the beaſts again and not ſeale the deed he will kill me, and thereupon I ſeale the deed; this is a good deed and ſhall bind me.

But ſtrangers to eſtates that are neither parties nor privies ſhall not be compelled to ſhew the deed though they make uſe of him.

But if the deed be denied then it is to be kept there untill it be determined. Alſo when a deed is ſhewed in Court the adverſe party may take any advantage by it that it will afford him, as if a feoffement be made by deed poll on condition, and the feoffee doth breake the condition and the feoffor doth enter and the feoffee doth ſue him and makes his title by that deed, the feoffee may take advantage of the Condition.</p>

As if he plead a releaſe to an obligation and it beareth date before the obligation; in this caſe he muſt averre that it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered after or it will not availe him. But a man may not in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet forth the delivery of a deed to be before the date of the deed. And yet if it be ſo that a deed be dated after the time of the delivery of it, the deed is good, and therefore if he that doth uſe ſuch a deed doe plead and ſet it forth as a deed made before the time of the delivery and the party that made it plead <hi>non eſt factum</hi> to the deed, a Jury upon the triall may finde the truth of <note place="margin">Eſtoppell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So alſo where a deed doth become void or loſe his virtue by the not reading, or not true reading of it to an illiterate man, or by refuſall or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as in the caſes before, the party may plead this plea to avoid it. But in all caſes where the deed is voidable and ſo remaineth at the time of the pleading, as if an Infant, or man of full age by dureſſe ſeale and deliver a deed; or if an obligation be well ſealed and delivered by two and the deed be joynt and the obligee ſue one of them; in theſe and ſuch like caſes the party bound by the deed may not plead <hi>Non eſt factum,</hi> for in the firſt and ſuch like caſes he muſt avoid it by ſpeciall pleading with concluſion of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>ſi Action &amp;c.</hi> and in the laſt he muſt plead in abatement of the writ &amp;c.

And in the Premiſſes there is ſometimes a Recitall, and ſomtimes an Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contained: but all theſe are not eſſentiall parts of a deed, for a deed may be good albeit it have not all theſe parts or it be not ſo formall and orderly drawn and made.</p>
               <p>The Premiſſes of a deed is all the forepart of the deed before the <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 6. 7. Co. 11. 51. 2. 55. Plow. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> demiſed or granted by the deed. And the office of this part of the deed is rightly to name the grantor and grantee and to comprehend the certainty of the thing granted, either by expreſſe words, or by that which by reference may be reduced to a certainty, and the exception or thing to be excepted if there be any. And in this part of the deed is the Recitall (if there be any in the deed) for the moſt part contained. And herein alſo is ſometimes (though improperly) ſet downe the eſtate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Habendum</hi> of a deed is that part of the deed which doth <note place="margin">2. <hi>Habendum. Quid.</hi>
                  </note> begin with To have and to hold. And this doth properly ſucceed <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 6. 7. 10. 107.</note> the Premiſſes. And the office hereof is to ſet downe againe the name of the grantee, the eſtate that is to be made and limited, or the time that the grantee ſhal have in the thing granted or demiſed, and to what uſe. And herein alſo is ſometimes though needleſly ſet downe againe the thing granted. But the deed that doth uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt of all theſe parts may be good notwithſtanding ſome of <note place="margin">3.

                  </note> them be omitted and it be not ſo formally made. For an eſtate may be made by a deed without any <hi>Habendum</hi> at all. As if one give or grant land to another and his heires, without any more words in the deed; or if one give or grant land to another, and limit no eſtate without any <hi>Habendum</hi> in the deed; and ſeale and deliver this deed and make Livery accordingly; in both theſe caſes the deed is good, and in the firſt caſe an eſtate in fee ſimple is made, and in the laſt caſe an eſtate for life is made. And if the name of the grantee be not contained in the Premiſſes, yet if it be in the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum,</hi> it may be good enough. As if one give or grant land <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum</hi> to <hi>B</hi> and his heires, and he is not named in the Premiſſes, yet this is a good deed to make an eſtate in fee ſimple. And yet if the thing granted be only in the <hi>Habendum</hi> and not in the Promiſſes of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115677:45"/> the deed, the deed will not paſſe it. And therefore if a man grant <note place="margin">Plow. 152<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dier 96. Perk. Sect. 251.</note> blacke acre only in the Premiſſes of a deed <hi>Habendum</hi> blacke acre and white acre; white acre will not paſſe by this deed. But if the thing newly added be implied in the thing granted by the Premiſſes of the deed, as being an incident thereunto or otherwiſe, or it be the ſame thing, and expreſſed in other words only, in theſe caſes the Premiſſes and the <hi>Habendum</hi> may ſtand together. As if one grant a manor, <hi>Habendum</hi> the manor with the Advowſon appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to the manor; or if one grant a Reverſion of land by the name of a reverſion in the premiſſes, <hi>Habendum</hi> the land it ſelfe, in both theſe caſes the deed is good and the advowſon and reverſion will paſſe. So alſo if livery of Seiſin be made of the thing newly added, in this caſe perhaps it may paſſe by the Livery. And if the thing granted be lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So if one grant land to <hi>A Habendum</hi> to him for 100. years; or <hi>Habendum</hi> to him and his aſſignes for 100. years; theſe are as good leaſes as the leaſe that is made by theſe words <hi>Habendum</hi> to <hi>A</hi> his executors, adminiſtrators and aſſignes for 100. years. So if a leaſe of land be made to <hi>A Habendum</hi> the land to him and his heires for 100. years, this is a good <hi>Habendum</hi> and the word [heirs] is void, and it ſhall goe to his executors &amp;c. As alſo where land is granted to <hi>A Habendum</hi> to him and his Succeſſors for 100. years; this is a good leaſe, and the word [Succeſſors] void, for it ſhall goe to executors &amp;c. And if a leaſe be made <hi>Habendum</hi> for years, and ſay not how many years; this is a good <hi>Habendum</hi> and a leaſe for two years.</p>

But if he adde withall theſe words in the deed [And all the intereſt that the defendant had in the land] or if he make ſale of it for a certain number of years only; this grant may be good notwithſtanding the miſrecitall.</p>
               <p>If one recite a former leaſe to be made ſuch a day to <hi>I S</hi> and <note place="margin">Dier 93. 160.</note> then make a new leaſe to begin after the end of the former leaſe, and miſtake the date of the old leaſe; in this caſe the deed is good notwithſtanding this miſtake.</p>

No more then where a man doth recite that ſuch land came to him by forfeiture, and then doth grant it by name; for in this caſe albeit it did not come to him by forfeiture but by ſurrender, yet this miſtake will not hurt. And yet in caſe of the King ſuch a miſrecitall may make the grant void.</p>
               <p>If I grant to <hi>I S</hi> all the lands in Dale which I purchaſed from <note place="margin">Dier 50. 87. 376.</note>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115677:48"/> ſaid to be his deed alone that is able, as if divers joine in the grant of a thing by deed &amp; one alone hath all the eſtate and the reſt have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the thing granted; it ſhal be ſaid to be his grant alone that hath the eſtate. And ſo <hi>è converſo.</hi> If a deed be made to one that is uncapable and to others that are capable, in this caſe it ſhall enure only to him that is capable. 2. A deed that is intended and made <note place="margin">Dier 251. Co. 2. 35. &amp; ſuper Lit. 49.</note> to one purpoſe may enure to another, for if it will not take effect that way it is intended it may take effect another way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a deed made and intended for a releaſe may amount to a grant of a Reverſion, an Atturnement, or a Surrender, or <hi>è converſo.</hi> And if a man have two waies to paſſe lands by the common law and he intendeth to paſſe them one way, and they will not paſſe that way; in this caſe <hi>ut res valeat</hi> it may paſſe the other way. As if a man beſeiſed of two acres of land in fee, and letteth one of them for years, and after intending to paſſe them both by feoffement maketh a Charter of feoffement and maketh livery in the acre in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the name of both the acres; in this caſe the acre in poſſeſſion only doth paſſe: but if the leſſee of the other acre Atturne then the reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſion of that acre will paſſe alſo. But where a man may paſſe lands by the Common law or by raiſing of a uſe and ſetling it by the Statute there in many caſes it is otherwiſe. As if the father make a Charter of feoffment to his ſonne and a letter of Atturney to make livery, and no livery is made; in this caſe no uſe ſhall ariſe to the ſonne. So if a man in conſideration of marriage make a feoffement with a letter of Atturney to give livery, and no livery is made; in this caſe no uſe will ariſe. And ſo was it held by Ch. Juſtice <hi>Popham B. R.</hi> for the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the parties doth work much in the raiſing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of uſes. And therefore it is ſaid that when a man doth intend to paſſe land one way it ſhall never paſſe another way contrary to <note place="margin">Dier 96.</note> his intent, as if one covenant for good conſiderations to levy a fine of land to the uſe of <hi>I S</hi> and his heires, if no fine be levied no uſe ſhall ariſe upon the covenant. If one by words of Bargain ſell, give <note place="margin">19 Eliz. Thorold &amp; Gordens caſe.</note> and grant, make a feoffement of his houſe for money, and intending to paſſe it by way of bargaine and ſale and Inrolment the deed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made there being a Maſter of the Chancery in the houſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the feoffement is made, he doth acknowledge and deliver the deed before him, in this caſe if the deed be not inrolled the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is void and that delivery ſhall not amount to a livery of ſeiſin. And yet when the intent is apparent to paſſe it one way or another <note place="margin">Experientia.</note> there it may be good either way, as where one doth make a feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fee with a letter of Atturney to make livery, and in the ſame deed doth covenant in caſe livery of ſeiſin be not had to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the deed to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſes of the feoffement, in this caſe albeit no livery of ſeiſin be made or atturnement had to perfect the feoffement or grant, yet if it be in ſuch a caſe where there is a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115677:48"/> conſideration ſufficient to raiſe the uſes by the covenant, the uſes will ariſe by the covenant. 3. When a deed may enure to divers purpoſes he to whom the deed is made ſhall have election which <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 301. Dier 251.</note> way to take it and he may take it that way as ſhall be moſt for his advantage. As if a deed of grant be made by the words <hi>Dedi &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſi;</hi> this in law may amount to a grant, feoffement, gift, leaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, confirmation or ſurrender, and it is in the choiſe of the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee to plead or uſe it the one way or the other. So if a leaſe for <note place="margin">Co. 2. 36. Dier 30. 302.</note> years be made to me of land for mony by the words demiſe, grant, bargain and ſell; I may take and uſe this by way of bargain and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ale, or by way of demiſe at my pleaſure. So if one have a rent out <note place="margin">Dier 109. 319.</note> of land whereof I and my wife are jointly ſeiſed, and he doth by his deed releaſe, give and grant this rent to me, in this caſe I may uſe this as a releaſe to extinguiſh the rent, or as a grant of the rent as it may make moſt for my advantage. <hi>Et ſic de ſimilibus.</hi> But where any inconvenience may grow by ſuch an election there the grantee ſhall not have an election but it ſhal enure as it may, as where a man may paſſe land by the common law or by raiſing of uſe and ſetling <note place="margin">Co. 2. 35, 36.</note> it by the Statute there ſometimes it is ſo. And therefore if in the ſame caſe before, a father make a Charter of feoffement to his ſonne and a letter of atturney to make livery and no livery is made; hereby no uſe will ariſe to the ſonne as it will in caſe of a covenant. And if a leaſe for years be made of a Manor by the words bargaine, ſell, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and grant, and this is to begin at a day to come; in this caſe it muſt paſſe entirely as a demiſe at the common law or entirely as a bargaine and ſale, and the leſſee hath not election to take or uſe it otherwiſe or to uſe it for part one way and for part another way. 4. It ſhall enure as much as may be according to the apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <note place="margin">Finches law. 58.</note> of the parties. And therefore it is that if a feoffement be made of a Manor with an advowſon appendant; or a bargaine and ſale of land in poſſeſſion and land in reverſion together be made and the feoffement is not well executed for want of livery of Seiſin or Atturnement, or the deed of bargaine and ſale is not inrolled; in theſe caſes albeit the advowſon may paſſe without livery or atturne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the reverſion without inrolment, yet becauſe the intent doth appeare to be that all ſhall paſſe together therefore neither the advowſon nor the reverſion will paſſe by this deed. 5. When a deed is made it ſhall enure as it may, and ſo as it may have and take <note place="margin">Plow. 140. 59. Co. ſuper Lit. 30<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if a man make a gift in tail, on condition that <note place="margin">Co. 6. 43.</note> the donee or his heirs ſhall not alien; this is a good condition to ſome intents, and void to other, and therefore if he make a feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fee, or any other eſtate by which the reverſion is diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tortiouſly, the donor ſhall enter, otherwiſe if he ſuffer a common recovery.

So if one make a leaſe for years of a houſe, on condition that if the leſſor ſhall be minded to dwell in the houſe, and ſhall give notice to the leſſee, that hee ſhall depart; in this caſe if the leſſor die, his heire, executor, &amp;c. ſhall not have the like advantage and power as the leſſor himſelf, for the condition ſhall not be extended to them.

But otherwiſe it is whiles the mortgagor doth live, for in that time <hi>I S</hi> alone without him may not tender it, and if he do, this tender is no performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

               <p>When an act is to be done in time convenient, or otherwiſe, and the party doe it not by the time appointed by law; the condition is <note place="margin">Li. Sect. 353. Plow. 30.</note> broken.</p>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man had made a leaſe for life reſerving rent, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that if the rent be behind the leſſor, his heires and aſſignes ſhall reenter, and after had granted the reverſion to a ſtranger; this grantee ſhould not by the common law have had benefit by this condition. But if the leſſor had died, his heire or the Gardian in Chivalry or Socage of ſuch an heire if he had been an Infant
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115677:82"/> and inward might have taken advantage by the condition. And if one had been poſſeſſed of a leaſe for years, and had granted his terme upon condition and had died; his executors or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators might have had advantage of this condition.</p>
               <p>And at this day the law is ſtill the ſame as touching Privies in <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 202. 12.</note> blood, for an heire ſhall take advantage of a condition, though no eſtate deſcend to him from the Anceſtor. And therefore if one be ſeiſed of land of the part of his mother, and he make a feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fee of it, on condition, and die, and the condition is broken; in this caſe the heire of the part of the father ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but as ſoone as he hath entred the heire of the part of the mother ſhall enter upon him and enjoy the land. And if a man be ſeiſed of land in the right of his wife, and he make a feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fee of it, upon condition, and die; the heire of the husband ſhall enter for the condition broken, but the wife ſhall have the land. And ſo alſo is the law as touching Privies in right and repreſentation, for Executors and Adminiſtrators ſhall take advantage of a condition now as heretofore. And ſo alſo ſhall the Succeſſors of a Deane and Chapter, Biſhop, Arch-deacon, Parſon, Prebend, or any body Politique or corporate, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall or Temporall; theſe ſhall take advantage of conditions as heretofore they did. So alſo the law is the ſame as touching Privies in law, for they ſhall no more take advantage of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition now then heretofore. But as touching grantees of rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Privies in eſtate, there is ſome alteration made of the Law, for by a new law it is provided, That all perſons which <note place="margin">Sat. 32 H. 8. cap. 34.</note> ſhall have any grant of the King of any reverſion &amp;c. of any lands &amp;c. which pertained to Monaſteries &amp;c. as alſo all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being grantees or aſſignees &amp;c. to or by any other perſon or perſons, and their heires, executors, ſucceſſors and aſſignes, ſhall have like advantage againſt the feoffees &amp;c. by entry for not payment of rent, or for doing waſt, or for other forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp;c. as the ſaid leſſors or grantors themſelves ought or might have had.</p>
               <p>And for the true underſtanding of the ſenſe of this Statute <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 214. Plow. 27.</note> and the ancient Common law further touching this point, 1. Theſe diverſities muſt be obſerved to be taken before the Statute which take place ſtill.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Between a condition that doth require a reentry, and a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation <note place="margin">Co. 10. 36. F. N.

But if a leaſe for years had been made on ſuch a condition; a grantee of the reverſion might by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law have taken advantage of this condition, for the eſtate in this caſe was by the breach of the condition <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void without entrie. But now the grantee of the reverſion ſhall have advantage of the condition in both theſe caſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>2. Theſe Reſolutions and Judgements upon the Statute muſt be marked. 1.

That the Statute doth extend to grants made to the ſucceſſor of the King aſwell as to the King albeit he only be named in the Statute. 3. That he that comes to the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by fine, feoffement, grant, limitation of uſe, common recovery, or bargaine and ſale, is ſuch a grantee as is within the intendment of the Statute. 4. That where the Statute doth ſpeake of feoffees &amp;c. that it doth not extend to gifts in taile, and therefore if a gift in taile be upon condition, and after the donor doth grant the reverſion; this grantee ſhall never have any benefit of this condition. 5. That where the Statute doth ſpeake of grantees and aſſignees of the reverſion; that hereby an aſſignee of part of the ſtate of the reverſion may take advantage of the condition, as if leſſee for life be, and the reverſion is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for life &amp;c. or if leſſee for years be &amp;c. and the reverſion is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for years &amp;c. in theſe caſes the grantees of the reverſion ſhall have advantage of the conditions.</p>

And therefore is a leaſe be made of three acres reſerving rent upon condition, and the reverſion is granted of two of the three acres; in this caſe the <note place="margin">Prerogative.</note> rent ſhall be apportioned, but the condition is deſtroyed except it be in the Kings caſe. And yet a condition may be apportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Apportionme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> by the act of law, or by the wrong of the leſſee. As if a leaſe be made of two acres (the one of the nature of Burrough Engliſh, and the other at the Common law) upon condition, and the leſſor having iſſue two ſonnes dieth; in this caſe each of them ſhall enter for the condition broken. And if the leſſee upon condition make a feoffment of part of the land; this doth not deſtroy the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is therefore herein a difference between a condition <note place="margin">Power of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> that is compulſory, and a power of revocation that is voluntary: for he that hath ſuch a power may by his own act extinguiſh it in part, by levying a fine of part of the land or otherwiſe, and yet his power may remain for the reſidue as in the caſe of a limitation; but in the caſe of a condition he cannot doe ſo. 8. Such grantees as ſhall have advantage by this Statute, muſt be compleat grantees; <note place="margin">Co. 5. 113, 114. Co. 8. 92.</note> And therefore grantees of reverſions by fine, or deed, muſt have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnment ere they can take advantage of the condition. And yet if a reverſion be granted by fine to one that hath no atturnment, and he grant it to another that hath an atturnment; in this caſe the ſecond grantee ſhall take advantage of the condition, albeit the firſt grantee ſhall not. And the leſſee muſt have notice of the grant of the reverſion, ere he in reverſion can take any advantage of a condition. And therefore it is, that if the leſſor bargain and ſell the land by deed indented and inrolled (in which caſe there needs no atturnment); or if the leſſor make a feoffment of the land, and ſo out the leſſee, and the leſſee reenter (which is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnment in law); the grantee or feoffee in theſe caſes cannot take advantage of any condition before he hath given notice to the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee of this grant of the reverſion. 9.

And of conditions that are colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall, ſuch grantees ſhall not take benefit. And therefore if the condition be for payment of a ſum of mony in groſſe, to reſtraine alienation, for the delivery of corn, wood, or the like, the grantee of the reverſion of the land ſhall not have advantage of it by this Statute, for theſe remain as they were before the Statute at the Common law. 11. Such conditions as are on the part of the leſſor, it ſeems are not within this Statute; And therefore if one <note place="margin">Per Juſtice Bridgman.</note> make a leaſe for years, on condition that if the leſſor, his heirs or aſſigns, pay ten pound to the leſſee at our Lady day, the leaſe to bee void, &amp; the leſſor doth grant the reverſion to a ſtranger before the day; it ſeems the grantee ſhall not take advantage of this; but the condition is gone.</p>

But if he die before demand, the heire cannot make a demand, and ſo take advantage of that breach of the condition, which was in the time of his Anceſtor.</p>
               <p>If a man be poſſeſſed of land for twenty years in the right of his <note place="margin">Perk.

                  <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 218. 237.</note> may enter, he muſt enter, and when he cannot enter, he muſt make a claim; for an eſtate of freehold or inheritance will not ceaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entry or claim. And he that is to have advantage by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, may wave his advantage if he will. And untill ſuch entrie or claim made, the party that ſhould enter can make no good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the thing to any other. But herein a difference is to be obſerved in the penning of a condition, and between a leaſe for yeares and a leaſe for life or a greater eſtate: for if a leaſe for years be made, on condition that upon ſuch a contingent the eſtate ſhall ceaſe, or the leaſe ſhall be void; in this caſe when the thing doth happen, the leaſe is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void without entry or claim. But otherwiſe it is of a leaſe for life, albeit there be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115677:84"/> the ſame words in the condition. And if one make a leaſe for years, on condition that if ſuch a thing be done, the leſſor ſhall reenter; in this caſe an entry is needfull to avoid the eſtate.</p>
               <p>If one make a feoffment in fee, gift in taile, or leaſe for life, on condition that upon ſuch a contingent the eſtate ſhall be void; in this caſe there muſt be an entry made, after the condition is broken to avoid the eſtate. So if one bargain and ſell his land by deed indented and inrolled, with proviſo that if the bargainor pay &amp;c. then the eſtate ſhall ceaſe and be void, &amp; he doth pay the mony; in this caſe the eſtate is not reveſted in the bargainor before an actuall reentry is made. And ſo it is alſo if lands be deviſed to a man and his heirs, on condition that if the deviſee doe not pay twenty pound at a day, his eſtate ſhall ceaſe and be void; in this caſe the eſtate is not void untill an actuall reentry be made. And ſo alſo it is if a reverſion, remainder, advowſon, rent, common, or the like, be deviſed on ſuch a condition; in theſe caſes there muſt be a claime before the eſtate will be determined. And therefore if a man grant ſuch a thing to another and his heirs, on condition that if the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pay twenty pound on ſuch a day, the ſtate of the grantee ſhall ceaſe or be void, and the grantor doth pay the mony according to the condition; in this caſe the ſtate is not reveſted in the grantor before a claim made at the Church in caſe of an Advowſon, and in the other caſes upon the land. But in caſe where a man cannot make an entry or claim, there the law will not compell him to it. And therefore if one grant land to another for five years, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that if he pay to the grantor within the two firſt years forty marks, that then he ſhall have the fee, otherwiſe but for tearm of five years, and livery of ſeiſin is made accordingly, and the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee doth not pay this mony; in this caſe after the two years are paſt, the freehold ſhall be in the grantor without entry or claim, for as this caſe is, he cannot enter, but he muſt out the leſſee of his term. So if I grant a rent charge out of my land upon condition; when the condition is broken, the rent is extinct, and here needs no claim. So if a man make a feoſſment of land to me in fee, on condition that I ſhall pay him twenty pound ſuch a day &amp;c. and before the day I let the land to him for yeares, <note n="†" place="margin">Rent.</note> rendring rent, and after the condition is broken; in this caſe he may retain the land without entry or claime, and the rent is extinct. So if one covenant to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of himſelf for life or otherwiſe, and then after to the uſe of others, with a proviſo of revocation &amp;c. and after he doth revoke it; in this caſe all the eſtates are reveſted in him without entry or claim.</p>

And hence it is, that if there be any charge or incumbrance on the land, as if leſſee of land upon condition grant a rent charge out of the land, or enter into a Statute or Recogniſance, and the conuſee have the land in execution, and this charge is after the condition is made; in this caſe when the condition is broken, and the party doth reenter, hee ſhall by relation avoid the rent, ſtatute, and recogniſances, and hold the land freed from them all. And if an eſtate be to paſſe by way of increaſe, upon condition, or a leaſe is to be made upon a condition precedent; when the condition is performed, the party ſhall hold his eſtate free from all after charges and clogs. And if a man enter for breach of a condition in <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 234. Perk. Sect. 843, 844. Co. ſuper Litt. 233.</note> law, hee ſhall avoid all charges and acts done after that thing is done which doth produce the forfeiture, but he ſhall not avoid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing done before that time; for he muſt take the thing as hee findes it: as if a houſe or land belong to an officer in reſpect of his office, and he grant a rent out of it for his life, and then he doth forfeit it; in this caſe the rent ſhall continue. And if leſſee for life of land grant a rent out of it, and then make a feoffment in fee of the land; in this caſe the rent ſhall continue, and the leſſor cannot avoid. But if leſſee for life of land make a feoffment in fee of it, and then grant a rent out of the land; in this caſe the leſſor ſhall avoid it. And if a leſſee grant a rent out of his land, and then doe waſt, and the leſſor recover the land, he cannot avoid this rent, but ſhall hold the land charged with it. But if the leſſee doe waſt firſt, and then he grant a rent charge to a ſtranger out of the land, and after the leſſor recover the place waſted; in this caſe he ſhal hold the land diſcharged. And if leſſee for life make a leaſe for years, and after enter upon the leſſee for years, and make a feoffment in fee; this ſhall not avoid the leaſe for years. And if a man make a leaſe for <note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But if there be any covinous practiſe in the caſe, the undertenants may have remedy <note place="margin">Equity.</note> in Equity. And if a leaſe be made for life, the remainder in <note place="margin">Co. 10. 41.</note> taile on condition; in this caſe if the condition be broken, both the eſtates be avoided. <hi>Et ſic de ſimilibus.</hi> But this generall rule <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 202. Perk. Sect. 242. 842, 843.</note> doth faile in divers particulars: as if a man bee ſeiſed of land in the right of his wife, and he maketh a feoffment in fee by deed inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, upon condition that the feoffee ſhall deviſe the land to the feoffor for life &amp;c. and the husband dieth, and then the condition is broken; in this caſe the heir of the husband ſhall enter, and yet he ſhall not have the eſtate of the feoffor, for this doth preſently after his entry vaniſh away. So if a tenant in ſpeciall tail hath iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115677:85"/> and his wife dieth, and tenant in taile maketh a feoffment in fee upon condition, the iſſue dieth, the condition is broken, and then the feoffor doth reenter; in this caſe he ſhall have but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for life as tenant in tail after poſſibility of iſſue extinct. So if a leſſee for life or years make a feoffment in fee on condition, and after doth enter for the condition broken; in this caſe he ſhall not be in in the ſame courſe, for now his eſtate is ſubject to entry for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, though he be tenant for life ſtill. So if a diſſeiſor be of certain land, and he die ſeiſed thereof, and his heir is in by deſcent, and the diſſeiſee enter upon the heir, and infeoffe a ſtranger upon condition, and the heir of the diſſeiſor doth enter upon the feoffee, and the diſſeiſor, doth ſue a writ of entry <hi>ſur diſſeiſin,</hi> againſt the heir of the diſſeiſor, and doth recover and hath execution, and the feoffee on condition doth reenter, and after the condition is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; in this caſe the feoffor is not in in the ſame caſe, for now the diſſeiſor cannot enter upon him as he might before. And in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the feoffor by his reentry ſhall be in in his former eſtate, but not in reſpect of ſome collaterall qualities: as if tenant by homage An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtrell, make a feoffment of the land he doth ſo hold in fee, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and entreth for the condition broken; in this caſe it ſhall never be held in homage Anceſtrel again. And ſo if a copyhold eſcheat be, and the Lord make a feoffment in fee upon condition, and entreth for the condition broken; in this caſe the cuſtome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that land is gone. So if there be Lord and tenant by fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and rent, and the Lord is in ſeiſin of the rent, and granteth his Seigniory to another and his heirs on condition, and the tenant doth atturn and payeth his rent to the grantee, the condition is broken; the Lord diſtraineth for his rent, and reſcous is made, in this caſe the former ſeiſin ſhall not enable him to have an aſſiſe without new ſeiſin. If there be Lord and tenant, and the Lord diſſeiſe the tenant of the tenancy, and thereof doth enfeoffe a ſtranger on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and after the condition is broken, and the Lord enter, and the tenant doth enter upon him; in this caſe the Seigniory is not revived.</p>
               <p>If tenant in tail make a feoffment in fee on condition, and dieth, and the iſſue in tail within age doth enter for the condition bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; in this caſe he ſhall be in firſt as tenant in feeſimple, and heir to his father, and then ſhall be preſently remitted: but if he be of full age he ſhall not be remitted.</p>
               <p>If one make a feoffment of white acre and black acre, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp;c. and that he ſhall enter into black acre onely; in this caſe <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 202, 203.</note> upon breach of the condition, he ſhall enter into that part onely.</p>
               <p>If the words of a condition be, That if ſuch a thing be not done, the feoffor or leſſor ſhall enter into the land, and take the profits thereof untill the thing be done, or to the like effect; in this caſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115677:85"/> if the feoffor or leſſor enter upon the breach of the condition, hee doth not avoid the eſtate, or get any thing by his entry, but the poſſeſſion onely in the nature of a pledge, or a diſtreſſe untill the thing be done; And if the condition be for the payment of the rent, he ſhall hold the land untill he be paid the rent. And if the words be [That the feoffor &amp;c. ſhall enter and take the profits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thereof he be ſatisfied, or untill he be ſatisfied or paid the rent] in the firſt caſe as ſoon as he is paid, either by the receiving of the profits, or payment of the rent behind, or both together; and in the laſt caſe as ſoon as he is paid the rent by the feoffee or leſſee, the feoffee or leſſee may enter again into the land.</p>
               <p>If a condition be poſſible in his creation, and after become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 207. 219. 15 H. 7. 13. Dier 262.</note>

So if the condition of a feoffment be that if the feoffor or his heirs pay ten pound to the feoffee ſuch a day, and before the day the feoffor dieth without heire; in this caſe the condition is gone. And if the condition become impoſſible in part onely, then it is diſcharged for ſo much onely.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of a Warranty.</head>
               <p>A Warranty is a covenant reall annexed to lands or tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Finch. ley 39. Co. ſuper Lit. 365.</note>

And he that doth make this warranty is called the warrantor, and he to whom it is made <note place="margin">Warrantor. Warrantee.</note> the warrantee.</p>
               <p>There are two kind of warranties. 1. A warranty in deed, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Quotuplex.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <note place="margin">Co. 1. 2. ſuper Lit. 365. 4. 81.</note> or an expreſſe warranty, which is when the ſame is expreſſed. <hi>i.</hi> when a fine, or feoffement by deed is levied or made in fee, or a leaſe for life is made by deed, comprehending warranty, or which hath an expreſſe clauſe of warranty contained in it, as when a conuſor, feoffor, or leſſor doth covenant to warrant the land to the conuſee, feoffee, or leſſee; whch is in theſe words. <hi>Ego</hi> I S <hi>&amp; heredes mei warrantizabimus &amp; imperpetuum defendemus</hi> W S <hi>&amp; heredibus ſuis tenementa predicta contra omnes homines imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum.</hi> And by the Statute of <hi>Bigamis Dedi</hi> is made an expreſſe warranty during the life of feoffor. 2. A warranty in law, or an implied warranty, which is when it is not expreſſed by the party but <hi>tacite</hi> made and implied by the law, whereof ſee divers Examples <hi>infra.</hi> The warranty in deed alſo is either lineall, which <note place="margin">Co. ſuper 383, 384. 370. 365.</note> is thus deſcribed. A covenant reall annexed to the land by him which either was owner or might have inherited the land and from whom his heire lineall or collaterall might by poſſibility have claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the land as heire from him that made the warranty. Or elſe it is collaterall, which is thus deſcribed. A warranty made by him that had no right or poſſibility of right to the land and is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall to the title of the land. Alſo there is a warranty which doth commence by diſſeiſin or wrong, of all which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115677:98"/>

                  </gap>ee divers examples afterwards. And note that all theſe things here are to be applied to warranties of lands and concerning freeholds and inheritances, for there is a warranty of goods and cattells in contracts of which we treat not here.</p>
               <p>The fruit and effect of this warranty in deed is, that it doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 265. 372. 365. 384.

And therefore if the father be diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And for the moſt part alſo it doth conclude and barre the heires of him that made the warranty to whom the ſame warranty doth deſcend to demand the ſame land againſt the warranty, for if it be a lineall warranty, it is a barre of an eſtate in fee ſimple without any Aſſets. <hi>i.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other land deſcended to him in fee ſimple from the ſame Anceſtor that made the warranty: And with aſſets it is a barre of an eſtate in taile. And if it be a collaterall warranty, it is with or without aſſets a barre of an eſtate in fee ſimple or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ee taile, and all poſſibility of right thereunto; and yet ſo as it doth not paſſe any eſtate or right but only bind the right ſo long as the warranty is in force, for if the warranty be avoided the right may be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But neither the lineall or collaterall warranty can enlarge an eſtate. And therefore if a leſſor by deed releaſe to his leſſee for <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 389. &amp;c.</note> life, and warrant the land to him and his heires; this doth not make his eſtate greater, neither will it barre titles of entry or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in caſes of Mortmaine, conſent to a Raviſhor, mortgage, or dower. And therefore if an Anceſtor of the Lord hath title to enter upon an Alienation in Mortmaine, and he releaſe, or make a feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with warranty; this warranty will neither barre him nor his heire. So if a collaterall Anceſtor will make a warranty which doth after deſcend upon one that hath title of entry upon a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion broken; this will not barre his entry &amp;c. neither will it barre any right that ſhall commence after the warranty made. And the warranty that doth commence by diſſeiſin doth not bind or barre any eſtate with or without Aſſets.</p>
               <p>And in caſes where the lineall or collaterall warranty is a barre, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 265. Co. 10. 98, 99. Dier 42.

               <p>And this warranty in Law is of the nature of a lineall warranty, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 384.</note> and ſhall bind as a lineall warranty onely, for it doth never barre any collaterall title. And hence it is, that this warranty and aſſets in ſome caſes is a good bar, as if tenant in tail exchange for other lands which are deſcended to the iſſue, and he hath accepted of them, or if not, that other lands are deſcended to him. But if tenant in tail of lands make a gift in tail or leaſe for life rendring rent and

So if ſuch a diſcontinuee make a feoffment in fee, or be diſſeiſed, and the uncle releaſe with warranty to the diſſeiſor, or feoffee, and die without iſſue, and the warranty doth deſcend on the iſſue; this is a collaterall warranty.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115677:104"/> make a feoffement with warranty, and this warranty doth deſcend on his heir; this warranty doth commence by diſſeiſin.

So if father and ſonne purchaſe lands to them jointly &amp;c. and the father alien the whole to another with warranty &amp;c. and after the father dieth; this warranty as to the one moity doth beginne by diſſeiſin. But if the purchaſe bee to them two and the heires of the ſonne it is otherwiſe, for if the ſonne enter in the life time of the father, the warranty is avoided for all, but if hee doe not enter, then as to the fathers moity it is a collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall warranty. And if the purchaſe be to the father and ſon and the heirs of the father, and the father alien with warranty &amp;c. in this caſe the warranty is good for the whole.</p>
               <p>If the father be tenant for life, the remainder to his ſon and heir <note place="margin">Co. 5. 80. ſuper Litt. 366. 367.</note> in fee, and the father by covin and conſent of purpoſe to bar the heir by a collaterall warranty maketh a leaſe for years, to the end that the leſſee ſhould make a feoffment in fee that the father may releaſe to the feoffee with warranty, and all this is done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and the father dieth, and the warranty doth deſcend to the ſonne; in this caſe the warranty ſhall be ſaid to beginne by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin. But if the father in this caſe make a feoffement in fee with warranty and die; this is a good warranty to binde the ſonne, albeit it be done of purpoſe to bar him. So if one brother make a gift in taile to another, and the uncle doth diſſeiſe the donee, and infeoffeth another with warranty, the uncle dieth and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty deſcendeth on the donor, and then the donee dieth without iſſue; this warranty doth begin by diſſeiſin. So if the father and ſon, and a third perſon be jointenants in fee, and the father ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a feoffment in fee of the whole, with warranty, and dieth, and then the ſonne doeth; in this caſe as to the part of the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to the part of the ſonne, the warranty ſhall be ſaid to beginne by diſſeiſin. But releaſes at this day by a tenant for life to a diſſeiſor or any other without covin, albeit it bee to the intent to barre him in reverſion ſhall barre him, for intent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out covin and diſſeiſin ſhall not avoid a warranty. And exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of warranties that doe begin by diſſeiſin, have theſe qualities; 1. That for the moſt part the diſſeiſin is done immediately to the heire that is bound by the warranty. 2. The warranty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin are <hi>ſimul</hi> and <hi>ſemel.</hi> And yet if a man diſſeiſe another with intent to make a feoffment with warranty, albeit the feoffement be made twenty years after the diſſeiſin, yet it ſhall be ſaid to bee a warranty that doth beginne by diſſeiſin. But in all theſe caſes of warranties that doe beginne by diſſeiſin, this is the rule, That
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115677:105"/> they are altogether void and without force as to all others but to the parties themſelves that doe make them, and therefore they do not barre or binde any others at all of their right that have any. And the ſame Law is of a warranty that doth begin by abatement or intruſion; that is, when an abatement or intruſion is made of purpoſe to make a feoffement in fee with warranty. And ſo alſo it is where the tenant dieth without heir, and an Aunceſtor of the Lord doth enter before the entry of the Lord, and make a feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fee with warranty; in this caſe this ſhall not binde the Lord, becauſe it doth begin by wrong.</p>
               <p>All warranties in generall are favourably taken in Law, becauſe <note place="margin">11. How a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The warranty in Law that is made upon a gift in tail, or leaſe for <note place="margin">Co. 4. 81. ſuper Litt. 384.</note> life, rendring rent, is a ſpeciall warranty againſt the donor and leſſor, and his heirs and aſſignes, ſo that the donee or leſſee may vouch the grantor after the grant of the reverſion, or the grantee of the reverſion after the atturnment of the tenant at his election.</p>
               <p>The warranty in Law that is made upon an Exchange, is ſpecial in <note place="margin">Co. 4. 121. ſuper Litt. 384.</note> divers reſpects, for it extendeth reciprocally to, and againſt the heires of both parties, and it doth extend only to the ſame land that is given in exchange and none other; and no uſe can be made of it but by voucher, for no <hi>Warrantia Cartae</hi> doth lie upon it.

               <p>If one make an eſtate and grant to warrant the land, but doth not ſay how long; this ſhall bee taken for as long as the eſtate to which the warranty is knit doth laſt.</p>

               <p>If a man bee ſeiſed of a rent-ſeck, iſſuing out of the Manor of <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 366.</note> Dale, and hee take a wife, and the husband doth releaſe to the terre-tenant, and warranteth <hi>tenementa praedicta</hi> and dieth; this warranty ſhall extend to the rent as well as to the land; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the wife ſue for her thirds of the rent, the terre-tenant may vouch the heire.

And therefore if grantee of a rent grant it to the tenant of the land on condition, and the tenant doth make a feoffment of the land with warranty; in this caſe the warranty ſhall not extend to the rent, albeit the feoffment be made of the land diſcharged of the rent. And if a woman have a rent-charge in fee, and ſhe doth intermary with the tenant of the land, and a ſtranger doth releaſe to the tenant of the land with warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this warranty ſhall not extend to barre any action to be brought after the death of the wife for the rent.

               <p>If lands be given to two brethren in fee ſimple, with warranty to the eldeſt and his heirs, and the eldeſt die without iſſue; in this caſe albeit the other brother be his heire, yet he ſhall have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage at all by the warranty, becauſe he comes in above the warranty. But generally all that claime under the warranty ſhall take advantage thereof by way of rebutter, albeit they can take no other advantage by it.</p>
               <p>If one make a feoffment to two their heirs and aſſigns, and one of them doth make a feoffment in fee, this feoffee in this caſe ſhall not take advantage as aſſignee.</p>
               <p>An aſſignee of part of the land ſhall take advantage of a warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 385.</note> as if a man make a feoffment of two acres with warranty to him, his heirs and aſſigns, and the feoffee doth make a feoffment of one acre of it to another; in this caſe the ſecond feoffee ſhall take advantage of the warranty as aſſignee. And therefore herein there is a difference between the whole eſtate in part, and part of the eſtate in the whole or in any part, for if a man have a warranty to him, his heirs and aſſigns, and he make a leaſe for life, or gift in tail; in theſe caſes the leſſee or donee ſhall not take advantage of the warranty as aſſignes: but they may vouch the leſſor or donor upon the warranty in Law. But if a leaſe for life bee made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 384.</note> in fee; ſuch a leſſee may vouch as aſſignee upon the firſt warranty. If the father have a feoffment made to him and his heirs with warranty, and he make a feoffment to his ſon and heire with warranty; in this caſe the ſon may take advantage of the firſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty after his fathers death. If a man infeoffe a woman with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 390.</note> and they intermary and are impleaded, and upon the default of the husband the wife is received; in this caſe ſhe may vouch her husband. <hi>Et ſic è converſo.</hi> If a woman infeoffe a man with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and they intermary and are impleaded; the husband in this caſe ſhall vouch himſelf and the wife.</p>
               <p>He that comes into the land meerly by act of Law in the poſt, as <note place="margin">26 H. 8. 3. 22 Aſſ. pl. 37. 29 Aſſ. 34. Co. 3. 62, 63.</note> the Lord by Eſcheat, or the like, ſhall never take advantage of a warranty, and therefore if tenant in dower infeoffe a villain with warranty, and the Lord of the villaine enter; or a feoffment bee to a baſtard with warranty, and hee die without iſſue, and the Lord enter by Eſcheat; in theſe caſes the Lord ſhall never take advantage of theſe warranties. But otherwiſe it is where a

So if hee to whom the warranty is made, ſuffer a common recovery, and after the Aunceſtor dieth; the recoveror may take advantage of this warranty by way of rebutter, for any man that hath the poſſeſſion of land, albeit he have no deed to ſhew how he came by the poſſeſſion of it, or how he is aſſignee, may rebut the demandant, and ſo barre him and defend his owne poſſeſſion; And therefore the tenant by the curteſie, donee in taile that is in of another eſtate, an aſſignee by force of a warranty made to a man and his heirs, feoffee of a donee in taile may rebut and bar the demandant by the warranty.</p>
               <p>If one infeoffe another of an acre of ground with warranty, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 376. 1 Ed. 3. 13. 5 H. 7. 2.</note> and hath iſſue two ſons, and dieth ſeiſed of another acre of land of the nature of Burrough Engliſh; in this caſe albeit the warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſcend upon the eldeſt ſonne onely, yet both the ſonnes may be vouched. And ſo alſo it is of heires in Gavelkind; the eldeſt ſhall be vouched as heire to the warranty, and the reſt in reſpect of the inheritance. And in like ſort the heire at the Common law, and the heire of the part of the mother ſhall bee vouched, or the heire at the Common law may bee vouched alone at the election of the tenant. And in like ſort the heire at the Common law ſhall be vouched with the heire in Burrough Engliſh.

               <p>If two make a feoffment with warranty, and the one die; the ſurvivor ſhall not be charged alone with the warranty, but the heir <note place="margin">Co. 3. 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And <note place="margin">Weſt 2. part Symb. Sect. 251. Co. ſuper Lit. 48.</note> this is as ancient as a feoffment, for no feoffment is made without livery of ſeiſin, albeit livery of ſeiſin be ſometimes made upon other conveyances. And it was firſt invented as an open and notorious act to this end, and that by this meanes the country might take notice how lands doe paſſe from man to man and who is owner thereof, that ſuch as have title thereunto may know againſt whom to bring their actions, and that others may know that have cauſe of whom to take leaſes, and of whom to require wardſhips &amp;c. And by this means if the title come in queſtion the Jury can the better tell in whom the right is. And of this livery of ſeiſin there are two kinds. 1. A livery in deed. 2. A livery in law called a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 48.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">6. Quotuplex.</note> within view. The livery in deed is when the feoffor, donor &amp;c. by himſelfe or another taketh the ring of the doore of the houſe, or a turfe, or twig of the land, and delivereth the ſame upon the land unto the feoffee, donee, &amp;c. in the name of ſeiſin of the houſe, or ſeiſin of the land. And this is done ſometimes by the parties themſelves if they be preſent, &amp; ſometimes in their abſence by their atturnyes or procurators. The livery in law is where the feoffor ſaith to the feoffee being in view of the land, I give you yonder houſe to you and your heires, goe enter into the ſame and take poſſeſſion thereof accordingly, or the like.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this manner of conveyance by feoffment is ſo ancient <note place="margin">Bio. eſtates 4. Plow. 28. 29.</note>

And for this cauſe it worketh not only to tranſmit the preſent eſtate but alſo to barre all preſent and future rights and poſſibilities. If therefore one make a leaſe for life to <hi>I S</hi> the remainder to the right heires of <hi>I D</hi> (which <hi>I D</hi> is then living) and give livery of ſeiſin according to the deed; in this caſe albeit he in remainder be not capable of this remainder, yet by the livery it ſhall paſſe out of the feoffor, and ſhall be in Abeyance during the life of <hi>I S.</hi> So if a feoffment be made to one <hi>&amp; heredibus,</hi> without the word <hi>[Suis,]</hi> and livery of ſeiſin be made of the deed; this livery perhaps may make the eſtate good.</p>

But if there be more feoffees, donees, or leſſees, then one; in ſuch caſes albeit all of them die but one the livery of ſeiſin may be made to that one that doth ſurvive, and it will be good to him to execute the eſtate in all the land.

And yet if one part of a Manor be in one county, and theother part in another county in view of that part; in this caſe it ſeemes livery of ſeiſin in the one part in the one county in view of the other part in the other county is good &amp; ſufficeth for all.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115677:113"/> So if the ſeite of a Manor lie in one county, and the reſt of the Manor in another county; in this caſe the making of livery in the ſcite of the Manor is ſufficient for the whole Manor. If a feoffment be made of the Manor of Dale in Sale, the which Manor <note place="margin">Perk.

But if I be ſeiſed of one acre in fee, and poſſeſſed of another acre for years, and I make a feoffment of both acres and livery of ſeiſin in that acre on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whereof I am ſeiſed in fee in the name of both the acres <hi>contra,</hi> for this is as If I make a feoffment of land whereof I am ſeiſed and of other land whereof I am not ſeiſed &amp;c.

And accordingly it was agreed in a caſe in the Kings Bench <hi>Hil. 38 Eliz.</hi> which was, that a man was ſeiſed in fee of a Manor and <note place="margin">Mountague verſus Jefferies.</note> other lands called Groves, and he made a feoffment of it (Groves being then in leaſe for years) and a letter of atturny to give livery and the atturny made livery of the Manor in the name of the reſt, the leſſee being ſtill in poſſeſſion of Groves; in this caſe it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that this was no good feoffment for Groves.</p>
               <p>When a feoffment is made of a houſe and land, the livery of <note place="margin">See infra.</note> ſeiſin is moſt aptly to be made of and in the houſe in the name of the reſt, and at the doore of the houſe &amp;c.

               <p>To every good livery of ſeiſin is requiſite either ſuch an act as the <note place="margin">Co 9. 137. ſuper Lit. 49.</note>

               <p>The moſt uſuall formall and orderly manner of making of livery <note place="margin">Weſt. Symb. 1. part. Sect. 251. Perk. Sect. 209. 210. Co. ſuper Lit. 48.</note> of ſeiſin is thus, that the feoffor, donor, &amp;c. and the feoffee, donee, &amp;c. if they be preſent, or in their abſence their atturneys or ſervants that have authority doe come to the doore, backſide or garden if it be a houſe, if not, then to ſome part of the land where ſeiſin is to be delivered, and there in the preſence of many good witneſſes doe ſhow the cauſe of their meeting, openly and plainly, doe read the deed or declare the contents thereof and of the letter of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turny if there be any. And then the feoffor, &amp;c. or his atturny (if it be a houſe) doe take the ring, latch or haſpe of the doore (all the people, men, women and children being out of the houſe,) or (if it be of a peece of ground) doe take a clod of the ground or a bough or twig of a tree or buſh growing thereupon; and (all the people being out of the ground) the ſame ring &amp;c. clod, bough &amp;c. with the deed doe deliver to the feoffee, donee, &amp;c. or to his atturny: and in the delivery hereof doe uſe theſe or ſome ſuch like words. <hi>viz.</hi> I deliver theſe to you in the name of ſeiſin of all the lands and tenements contained in this deed To have and to hold according to the forme and effect of the ſame deed. Or, I deliver you ſeiſin and poſſeſſion of this houſe or ground in the name of all the lands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the deed according to the forme and effect of the deed. And then if it be a houſe the feoffee, &amp;c. doth enter in firſt alone and ſhut to the doore, and then he doth open it and let in others. And if the feoffment, gift, or leaſe be made without deed, then they doe and muſt withall expreſſe the very eſtate it ſelfe which the feoffee, donee, or leſſee is to have: as for example, the feoffor, donor, or leſſor muſt come to the houſe or land which is to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and where livery of ſeiſin is to be made and there muſt by apt words grant the houſe or land to him that is to have it in fee ſimple, or in taile, or for life, (as the agreement is) and in ſeiſin thereof muſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115677:114"/> deliver him the ring of the doore, or a turfe or twig of the land. And if the feoffment &amp;c. be made by writing then it is wiſdome to indorſe and ſet downe on the back of the ſame how, when, and where the ſame is made, and the names of the witneſſes thereunto. But a livery of ſeiſin that is not ſo exactly made may be good not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. And therefore if the feoffor, donor, &amp;c. or his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turny <note place="margin">Co. 9. 137. Fitz. feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; faits. 111.</note> take any thing elſe that comes from off the land, as a ſtone, or the like, and therewithall doth make the livery of ſeiſin; or if he take a turfe, or twig from off another mans ground and not from the ſame whereof poſſeſſion is to be given, and deliver that upon the ground in the name of ſeiſin; Or if he take a peece of ſilver or gold, or a rod, ſtick or the like, and deliver this upon the land in the name of ſeiſin; all theſe are good deliveries of ſeiſin and poſſeſſion. So <note place="margin">Co. 6. 26. 41 E. 3. 17.</note> if the feoffor &amp;c. be at the doore of the houſe, or by the land, or in the houſe, or upon the land, and after he hath delivered the deed he ſay to the feoffee, donee, &amp;c. [Here I deliver you ſeiſin and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this houſe or land in the name of ſeiſin and poſſeſſion of all the lands and tenements contained in the deed.] Or [have and enjoy this houſe or land according to the deed.] Or [enter into this land or houſe and God give you joy of it.] Or [I am content you ſhall enjoy this land;] in all theſe caſes there is a good livery of ſeiſin. <hi>Et ſic de ſimilibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I being ſeiſed of a houſe in fee make a feoffment of it and of <note place="margin">Bro. feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 28.</note> divers lands to a man then preſent with me in the ſame houſe, and there deliver him the deed in the name of ſeiſin of all the lands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the deed; in this caſe this is a good delivery of the deed, and a good livery of ſeiſin alſo, albeit I continue in poſſeſſion of the houſe ſtill and goe not out of it. And if I be Lord of a Manor, and <note place="margin">Perk.

So if I make a deed, and after I have read it, <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 215. Co 6. 26.</note> being upon the land I deliver it to the feoffee, donee, &amp;c. and ſay, Here I deliver you this charter as my deed in the name of ſeiſin of all the lands therein contained, or the like; this is a good delivery of the deed and of ſeiſin. But if I doe only ſeale and deliver the deed upon or in view of the land without ſaying or doing any more; this will not amount to a livery of ſeiſin. <note n="*" place="margin">Cromwals caſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in the exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer 15 Eliz.</note> And therefore if a man make a feoffment with a letter of atturny to give livery of ſeiſin, and then he deliver the deed upon the land; this is no good making of livery of ſeiſin.

               <p>If I be ſeiſed of a houſe in fee, and being in the houſe ſay to <note place="margin">Co. 6. 26.</note>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115677:115"/> will not amount to a livery of ſeiſin; and therefore it is no good leaſe untill livery of ſeiſin be made, but it is a good beginning of a leaſe.</p>
               <p>If the father infeoffe his ſonne of land, and the ſonne ſuffer <note place="margin">Perk.

               <p>If divers parcells of land be conveyed and livery of ſeiſin is made <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 48. Fitz.

               <p>If the feoffor, donor, &amp;c. deliver the deed in ſight or view of <note place="margin">Co. 9. 137. 6. 26. ſuper Lit. 48. 253.</note> the land, and uſe theſe or any ſuch like words, [I will that you <note place="margin">Livery in law, or within the view.</note> ſhall enter into the land and have it according to the deed;] Or, [take and enjoy the land according to the deed;] Or, [I deliver you this deed in the name of ſeiſin;] Or, [enter you into the land and take ſeiſin of it;] Or [take the land and God give you joy of it;] Or, (if the eſtate be made without deed) [I give you yonder land to you and your heires and goe &amp; enter into the ſame and take poſſeſſion thereof accordingly;] Or [enter into the land and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it in fee ſimple to you and your heires, or for your life &amp;c.] in all theſe caſes the eſtate and the livery is good albeit the feoffor &amp;c. ſtand in one county and the land in view be in another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

But where the livery of feiſin is made with relation to the deed, there it muſt take effect according to the deed or not at all, for theſe words <hi>ſecundum for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam cartae,</hi> are to bee underſtood according to the quantity and quality of the effectuall eſtate contained in the deed.

               <head>CHAP. X. Of a Bargain and Sale.</head>
               <p>THis word doth ſignifie the transferring of the property of a <note place="margin">Terms of the Law, Plow. 301. Co. 2. 35.</note> thing from one to another upon valuable conſideration. And <note place="margin">1. Bargain and Sale. <hi>Quid.</hi>
                  </note> herein only it doth differ from a Gift; that this may bee without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſideration or cauſe at all, and that hath always ſome merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe moving it, and cannot be without it. This word alſo is ſometimes applied to the aſſurance or conveyance whereby this is done and made, which is called a deed of Bargaine and Sale, for this may be done by writing or without writing.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes this is and may be of lands, tenements, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments, <note place="margin">Terms of the Law, Plow. 301. Co. 2. 35.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Quotuplex.</note> and to this the terme is moſt properly applied. And then it is ſaid to be, where a recompence is given by both parties to the bargain. As where one doth bargain and ſell his land to another for mony; in this caſe the land is a recompence to the one for the money, and the money to the other for the land. And this now alſo is become one of the common aſſurances of the kingdome, <note n="*" place="margin">Per Ch. Juſt. Hide. 3 C. 1. Co. 2. 54.</note> ſo that ſuch an aſſurance may now bee averred to bee fraudulent within the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> as well as any other aſſurance, a rent may be reſerved upon it, or a condition made by it, as well as by any other kind of aſſurance. And ſometimes this is and may be of moveable things, as trees, corn, graſſe, oxen, kine, houſhold-ſtuffe, and the like: the property whereof is and may be altered by this kind of conveyance, as well as by gift, or grant. And this kind of bargain and ſale is that which is commonly called a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: <note place="margin">Terms of the Law. Agreement.</note> which largely taken, is an agreement between two or more concerning ſomething to be done, whereby both parties are bound each to other, or one is bound to the other. But ſtrictly it is the buying and ſelling of ſome perſonall goods whereby the property is altered. And in both theſe caſes he that doth ſell is called the bargainor, and hee to whom the ſale is made is called the bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee. <note place="margin">Bargainor, Bargainee.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The effect of this is to transfer the property, and this it will as <note place="margin">Co. 8. 94. 5. 113. 3. 62.</note> effectually doe as any other kind of conveyance whatſoever. And <note place="margin">3. The effect of it.</note> therefore the bargainee of a reverſion howſoever he may not have
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115677:118"/> benefit of a condition upon the demand of a rent without giving notice of the bargain and ſale to the leſſee. And howſoever if <hi>A</hi> conuſee by a fine of a reverſion before atturnment of the tenant bargain and ſell the reverſion to <hi>B,</hi> that <hi>B</hi> cannot diſtraine for this rent untill he can get an atturnment of the tenant; yet the bargainee ſhal have benefit of a condition as an aſſignee within the Statute of 32 <hi>H.

And all manner of goods and chattels, as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for years, wardſhips, cattell, corn, houſholdſtuffe, wood, trees, merchandiſes, and the like, are grantable by way of bargain and ſale.

               <p>If any eſtate of freehold or inheritance be made of land by way <note place="margin">5. What ſhall bee ſaid a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain &amp; ſale. And what things are requiſite to make ſuch a bargain and ſale. Or not. Of lands.</note> of bargain and ſale, the ſame muſt be made by a writing or deed <note place="margin">Stat. 27 H. 8. ch. 16.</note> indented, and cannot be made by word of mouth onely, as a leaſe for years, whether it be created <hi>de novo,</hi> or be in <hi>eſſe</hi> before, may be. But lands in <hi>London</hi> by a ſpeciall Proviſo within the Statute may be bargained and ſold by word of mouth without any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. 2. The very words Bargain and Sell, are not neceſſary to a good bargain &amp; ſale, for words equivalent will ſuffice to make land <note place="margin">Co. 8. 94. 7. 40. 2. 36.</note> paſſe by way of bargain &amp; ſale. And therefore if a man ſeiſed of land in fee do by deed indented, and by the words alien, or grant, ſell them to another; or if ſuch a man covenant to ſtand ſeiſed of his land to the uſe of another, and theſe deeds are made in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of money, and the deeds be after inrolled; theſe will amount to good bargains and ſales. And if a man by a deed indented and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in conſideration of ten pound paid to him by the words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and grant, paſſe his lands to another for twenty years; this is a good bargain and ſale. 3. There muſt be ſome good conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Co. 1. 176.</note> given, or at leaſt ſaid to be given for the land. And therefore if <hi>A</hi> (for divers good conſiderations) <note n="a" place="margin">Ward ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Lambert Paſche 37 Eliz.</note> or (in conſideration that the bargainee is bound for the bargainor, and for divers other good cauſes) <note n="b" place="margin">41 El.

                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:115677:118"/> the bargainee may aver it, and being proved the bargain will bee <note place="margin">Averment.</note> good. And if the deed make mention of money paid, as in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of an hundred pound or the like, and in truth no money is paid, yet the bargain and ſale is good. And no averment will lie againſt this which is expreſly affirmed by the deed. And if the deed <note place="margin">Dier 90.</note> mention and ſay (for a certain ſum of money) or (for a certaine competent ſum of money), theſe are good conſiderations. 4. There needs no livery of ſeiſin or atturnment in this caſe. And therefore <note place="margin">Co. 7. 40. 8. 94.</note> if one bargain and ſell a reverſion by deed indented and inrolled for good conſideration; the reverſion will paſſe without any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnment of the tenant. And if it be onely a leaſe for years of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion that is granted, there needs no atturnment nor inrolment. And in caſe of a bargaine and ſale the bargainee is in actuall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before any entry, ſo that the leſſee may atturn to the grant of the reverſion, as hath been ruled in <hi>Mittons</hi> caſe, <hi>Mich. 18 Jac. in Cur'Ward.</hi> by the two Chief Juſtices and the whole Court. And yet I think he hath not ſuch a poſſeſſion as to bring any poſſeſſory action for treſpaſſe, or the like, untill an actuall entry: for where the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of uſes provides, that the actuall poſſeſſion ſhall be adjudged according to the uſe, yet it ought to have a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance <note place="margin">Co 5. 112.</note> which is requiſite by the common law, <hi>viz.</hi> an actuall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in deed. But there muſt be an inrolment of the deed in caſe <note place="margin">Stat. 27 H. 8. ch. 16. Pl. 307.</note> where any freehold doth paſſe, for it is provided, That no lands <note place="margin">Inrolment. Where neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And how it muſt be done.</note> (except in ſome Corporations only) ſhall paſſe from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any deed whereby any eſtate of inheritance or freehold ſhall be made or take effect in any perſon or perſons to be made by reaſon only of any bargain and ſale thereof, except the ſame be made and done by writing indented, ſealed and inrolled in one of the four Courts [the Chancery, Kings Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer], or elſe within the ſame County or Counties where the lands ſo bargained and ſold, doe lie before the <hi>Cuſtos Rotulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and two Juſtices of the Peace, and the Clerk of the Peace of the ſame County or Counties, or two of them at the leaſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Clerk of the Peace to be one. And the ſame inrolment to be within ſix moneths next after the ſame writing or deed is da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And this Statute was made in the ſame Parliament wherein the law of transferring of uſes into poſſeſſion was made, to the end that mens lands might not ſuddenly and privately paſſe upon payment of a little money in an alehouſe, or the like. And herein theſe things muſt be obſerved, 1. The inrolment upon ſuch a deed as to make this eſtate to paſſe, muſt be in parchment, for an inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in paper is not good. 2. The deed inrolled muſt be inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for if it be but poll, the eſtate will not paſſe. 3. It muſt be inrolled within ſix moneths of the purchaſe or ſale. <note n="*" place="margin">Co. 5. 1.</note> And this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt be, 1. From the date, and not from the time of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115677:119"/> delivery of the deed. 2. After twenty eight days to the moneth <note place="margin">2] Dier 218. Adjudge Franklin &amp; Garters caſe Mich. 37 &amp; 38 Eliz. 4] Dier 218.</note> and no more. 3. The day of the date to be taken excluſive, and for none of the days of the ſix moneths. And yet if a deed be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled the ſame day it bears date, it is good. 4. If it be inrolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the laſt day of the ſix moneths, it is ſufficient. And thus the deed may be inrolled within the ſixe moneths, albeit either of the parties die within the time. And if the deed be not thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, <note place="margin">Ruled in the Court of Wards. Co. 11. 48.</note> it is of no force at all. So that if one bargain and ſell his land to mee, and the trees upon it; in this caſe albeit the trees might have been ſold alone by deed without inrolment, yet now being not inrolled, becauſe the ſale is not good for the land, it ſhall not be good for the trees alſo. And no ſubſequent act will help in this caſe, for if one by words of bargain and ſell, onely without any other words in the deed grant a reverſion, and the deed be not inrolled, and after the tenant doth atturn; hereby nothing doth paſſe, neither ſhall it enure as a confirmation. But yet this muſt be noted that in ſome caſes where a deed will not enure by way of bargain and ſale for ſome of the cauſes aforeſaid it may enure to ſome other purpoſes. A bargain and ſale may be made of goods, <note place="margin">Experientia.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Of goods and cattels.</note> and cattels, without any ſuch ſolemnity as before, for it may bee by word as well as by writing, with or without any words of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and ſell as well as by thoſe words, by a deed poll, as well as by a deed indented, and that without any inrolment at all, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delivery of any part of the things ſold, or of any peece of money (as the manner is) in the name of ſeiſin. But in this caſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">Plow. 308.</note> ſome reſpect is to be had unto the cauſe and conſideration of the bargain, as well as in the caſe of the bargain and ſale of lands. For howſoever perhaps in the caſe of a grant or bargain, and ſale of goods or cattels by deed in writing, the conſideration is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall. And that if a man doe by his deed under his hand and ſeal bargain and ſell timber, trees, or any other thing without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration at all, the ſame may paſſe well enough; yet if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <note place="margin">Dier 29, 30. 14 H. 8. 19. 9 H. 7. 21. 21 H. 7. 6. 10 H. 7. 6.

And therefore if a man by word of mouth ſel to me his horſe, or any other thing, and I give him or promiſe him nothing for it; this is void and will not alter the property of the thing ſold. But if one ſell me a horſe, or any other thing for money, or any other valuable conſideration, and the ſame thing is to be delivered to me at a day certain, and by our agreement a day is ſet for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the money, or all, or part of the money is paid in hand, or I give earneſt money (albeit it be but a penny) to the ſeller, or I take the thing bought by agreement into my poſſeſſion where no money is paid, earneſt given, or day ſet for the payment; in all theſe caſes there is a good bargain and ſale of the thing to alter the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115677:119"/> propertie thereof; and in the firſt caſe I may have an action for the thing, and the ſeller for his money; in the ſecond caſe I may ſue for and recover the thing bought; in the third I may ſue for the thing bought, and the ſeller for the reſidue of the money; in the fourth caſe where earneſt is given we may have reciprocall remedies one againſt another; &amp; in the laſt caſe the ſeller may ſue for his money. If <hi>A</hi> ſell cloth to <hi>B</hi> for ten ſhillings, and <hi>B</hi> takes away the cloth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of <hi>A;</hi> in this caſe <hi>A</hi> ſhall have an action of treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe againſt <hi>B.</hi> And if <hi>A</hi> ſell cloth to <hi>B</hi> for ten ſhillings in his election to make it a bargain or not, and if he will he may keep his cloth untill the other pay him, and if <hi>A</hi> ſay nothing, but doth ſuffer <hi>B</hi> to take it away; he may make it a bargain if he will, and bring an action of debt for his money. If I offer money for a thing in a Market or Faire, and the ſeller agree to take my offer, and whiles I am telling the money as faſt as I can hee doth ſell the thing to another: Or when I have bought it we agree that he ſhall keep it untill I can goe home to my houſe to fetch the money; in both theſe caſes, eſpecially in the firſt the bargains are good, ſo as the ſeller may not ſell them afterwards to another, and upon the payment and tender and refuſall of the money agreed upon, I may take or recover the things.</p>

               <p>A Parſonage or Rectory, albeit it conſiſt of nothing but Tithes, <note place="margin">15 H. 7. 8. 16 H. 7. 3. 19 H. 8. 12. 21 H. 6. 43.</note>

But the tithes alone, or a portion of tithes, oblations, mortuaries, or obventions are not grantable by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without deed. And therefore a leaſe paroll of tithes, albeit <note place="margin">All this was agreed 36 El. B. R.</note> it be but for years is not good. And if the Parſon agree with one of his Pariſhioners, that he ſhall have his own tithes; this is not a good grant of the tithes, neither may it be pleaded or uſed ſo; but perhaps by way of agreement a Pariſhioner may retain his tithes. And if a leſſee for years of tithes will grant it over to another at will only, it cannot be done without deed, as was held by Baron <hi>Denham, 2 Car.</hi> at <hi>Sarum</hi> Aſſiſes. And yet it is held that a Parſon <note place="margin">Mich. 8 Jac.

               <p>An Advowſon in groſſe cannot be granted without deed; yea <note place="margin">21 Ed. 3. 38. 11 H. 4. 3. Dier 29. 10.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115677:122"/> without deed. And therefore if a man grant by word of mouth to me Common for twenty beaſts in his manor; this is not good.

And if a man grant to me common of paſture without number in his ground, and after make the like grant to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; this ſecond grant is void as to me, albeit it be good againſt the grantor. And if one grant the next preſentation to a Church after the death of the preſent Incumbent, and after grant the ſame to another; or make a leaſe of land to one for tenne years, and after make a leaſe of the ſame land to another for the ſame tenne years; or give a horſe to one and after give the ſame horſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in all theſe caſes the ſecond grant is void. But if the firſt grant or gift be only of part of the thing granted afterwards, or of part of the time only, the ſecond grant will be good for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus. And therefore if one be ſeiſed of a Manor and demiſe ten acres of the demeſne to tenne years, and after demiſe the whole Manor to another for twenty years; this is a good grant for the overplus of the Manor beſides the tenne acres, preſently, and for the whole Manor for the laſt tenne years.

And if one grant by the name of a great field that which in deed is but a little cloſe but it is uſually called by the name of a great field: this is a good grant of this thing.

But if there be no circumſtantiall matter in the grant to denote and decipher out where it doth lie; it ſeemes the grant is void for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty.

So if <note place="margin">Perk.

As where the Lord, or one that hath a rent out of land doth grant over his Seigniory, or his rent to another, or one that hath a reverſion or a remainder after an eſtate for life or years doth ſell or give the ſame away to another; in theſe caſes the tenant of the land muſt have notice of this ſale or gift, and of the alteration of the party to whom he muſt attend in his ſervices, and he muſt give his conſent to the ſame gift or grant, or elſe generally the ſame is not good.

But the grantee, his heire, or aſſignee, cannot diſtraine the tenant for rent, or bring any action that doth lie in privity between him and the tenant, as waſt upon a waſt done by the tenant, writ of entry <hi>ad communem legem,</hi> or <hi>in caſu proviſo,</hi> or <hi>in conſimili caſu</hi> upon the alienation of the tenant, eſcheate upon the dying of the tenant without heirs, or ward upon the death of the tenant his heire within age, or writ of cuſtomes and ſervices, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he have the atturnement of the tenant: and therefore as to all theſe purpoſes the atturnement of the tenant is neceſſary.

               <p>If a leaſe be made of a reverſion to beginne at a day to come; <note place="margin">Co. 2. 35.</note> in this caſe the atturnment may be made before or after the day ſo it be made in the life time of the parties.</p>
               <p>If one grant his reverſion of white acre or black acre, and <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 310.</note> the tenant atturne to the grant before the grantee have made his election which acre he will have, this is a good atturnment.</p>
               <p>If a man grant his reverſion by deed to one, and after and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tenant doe atturne he levy a fine or make a feoffment <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 309. 310. 8. 82. 4. 61.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115677:137"/> but of part of the land granted before in reverſion; in this caſe the firſt grant after atturnment ſhall bee good for the reſidue. And if a woman ſole grant a reverſion, and after the before atturnemnt ſhee mary with a ſtranger, and after the tenant atturne; in this caſe the atturnment comes too late, for the mariage is a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it. And if a reverſion of an eſtate for life or yeares be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the grantor before atturnment doth confirme the eſtate of the tenant for life or yeares and ſo change the eſtate, and after the tenant atturne, in this caſe the atturnment comes too late.</p>

It muſt be made to the perſon that ought to take it. 3. It muſt be made in time convenient. 4. If it be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe atturnment the tenant muſt firſt have notice of the grant of the reverſion, rent, &amp;c. to which he muſt atturne; but otherwiſe it is of an atturnment in law, for there notice in all caſes is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 5. And it muſt be done in that manner the law doth preſcribe. <note place="margin">Notice.</note> And for this it is to be knowne that it may be made by words or by deeds and without any writing, or by deed or writing (and this is the ſafeſt way to doe it.) And any words written or ſpoken by the tenant that doe import an aſſent and agreement to the grant of the reverſion, rent, &amp;c. in ſuch manner as the ſame is made after notice given to him of the grant whether it be in the preſence or the abſence of the grantee of the reverſion, rent, &amp;c. will make a good atturnment in deed. And therefore if the tenant after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the grant uſe theſe words following or any others to the like effect to the grantee, <hi>viz.</hi> I doe atturne, or turne tenant to you according to the grant; or, I become your tenant; or, I agree to the grant; or, I am well content with the grant; or, God ſend you joy of it; theſe are good expreſſe atturnments. And if the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">Lit. Sect. 563. 551. 513.

But if one have a rent charge iſſuing out of my land, and he grant it to a ſtranger; and I give him an oxe to put him in poſſeſſion of the rent; it ſeemes this is no good atturnment.</p>
               <p>If a man grant his reverſion of my living to <hi>I S</hi> and his Baylife <note place="margin">M. 2 Car. in the Court of Wards.

And an atturnment made to the Lords Steward in the Court in the abſence of the Lord is a good atturnment. For it is ſufficient if the tenant have notice, that he atturne to the grant in the preſence of any whomſoever. Tenant for life was, the remainder in tail, he in the remainder gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his remainder, the tenant for life having notice of the grant ſaith to a ſtranger in his abſence, That is the party, I am well pleaſed that the grant is made to him; it was adjudged to be good.</p>
               <p>If a reverſion be granted to one for life, and after the ſame rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 310. 11 H. 7. 12.</note> be granted to him for yeares, and the tenant atturne to both the grants at once; this atturnement is void for incertainty.

So if a reverſion be granted to two ſeverall perſons by ſeverall deeds, and the tenant atturne to both the grants at one time; this atturnment is void for incertainty, and neither of the grants are perfected by the atturnment in theſe caſes. The implied atturnment which alſo doth amount to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe atturnment is made divers manner of wayes.

But if the tenant <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 312.</note> after the grant of the reverſion, not having notice of the grant pay his rent to the grantee as a receiver, Bailife, &amp;c. this is no good atturnment. <note n="†" place="margin">Calvins caſe.

So if a man ſeiſed of a ſeigniory levie a fine of it, and then taketh backe an eſtate in fee, and the tenant having no notice of all this doth pay his rent to the conuſor as he was wont to doe; this is no good atturnment in law to perfect either of theſe grants.</p>
               <p>If there be Lord and tenant, and the tenant let the land to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Lit.

So if in this caſe the tenant leaſe to a man for life the remainder over and the Lord grant the ſervices to the tenant for life, and he accept thereof; this is a good atturnemnt in law.</p>
               <p>If the Lord by deed grant his ſeigniory to the tenant of the land <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 313.</note> and to a ſtranger, and the tenant doth accept of this deed; this is

               <p>If the conuſee of a fine of ſervices ſue a <hi>Scire facias</hi> to have execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Lit. Sect. 564.</note> of the ſervices, and hath Judgment to recover; this is a good atturnment in law.</p>
               <p>If a woman grant a reverſion to a man in fee, and after mary <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 310.</note> with the grantee, this is a good atturnment in law to perfect this grant made to the husband.</p>
               <p>If a Lord grant his ſeigniory, &amp; there be twenty manner of ſervices, <note place="margin">Lit.

               <p>If I be ſeiſed of land in fee, and make a leaſe for life or yeares of it, or it be extended by a Statute or Elegit, and then I make a feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Lit.

And if the conuſee of a reverſion by fine diſſeiſe the leſſee for life and make a feoffment in fee, and the leſſee reenter, this is no good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnment in law to the feoffee to enable him to diſtraine &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If one grant the reverſion of a leaſe of a terme of yeares, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Hil. 8 Jac.</note> any atturnment made, the leſſee for years doth grant his terme to the grantee of the reverſion; in this caſe this is no good atturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in law to make the reverſion to paſſe.</p>
               <p>If one have land and a rent iſſuing out of other land both in one county, and he grant both by deed, and give livery of ſeiſin of the <note place="margin">Perk.

               </p>
               <p>If a reverſion be granted of two acres, or for forty years, or if <note place="margin">Co. 2. 68. ſuper Litt. 297. 314. 309. Lit. ſect. 564.</note>

And that albeit the tenant ſay expreſly it ſhall be good but for a part and not for the whole. And ſo alſo it is of an atturnment in law. And therefore if the grantee by fine of ſervices ſue a <hi>Scire facias</hi> to have execution of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the ſervices, and have judgement to recover any part, or a leſſee of three acres ſurrender one of them to the grantee of the reverſion of all the three acres; this is a good atturnment for the whole. But if one atturn for part of the land, or for part of the ſervices in caſe of the grant of a reverſion of land, or the grant of ſervices, and have no notice of the grant of any more, this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnment is not good for any part, but void for all.</p>
               <p>If a ſeigniory, reverſion, or the like, be granted to two or more, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 297. 2. 68. 67.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Atturnment to one good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> and the tenant after notice thereof doth atturn to one of them; this is a good atturnment to perfect the grant to both or all of them. But if one die before atturnment, and the tenant atturne to the ſurvivor or ſurvivors; this ſhall not availe the heire of him that is dead, but it is good to perfect the grant to the ſurvivor or ſurvivors, to whom it is made.</p>
               <p>If a reverſion be granted to husband and wife, and the tenant <note place="margin">Calvins caſe Paſc. 7 Jac. B. R. Co. 2. 68.</note> atturne to the wife in the abſence of the husband; this is a good atturnment to perfect the grant to them both. But if a reverſion bee granted to two men, and the tenant have notice onely of a grant made to one of them, and he atturn to him onely; this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnment is void, and not good to perfect the grant to either of them.</p>
               <p>If two jointenants be for life, or years, and the reverſion of their <note place="margin">Co. 2. 66, 67. Litt. Sect. 566.</note>

But if <hi>A, B, C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> be leſſees <note place="margin">6 Car. in the Lord Brooks caſe in the Court of Wards.</note> for years, and <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> be outlawed, ſo as they forfeit their parts to the King, and the King become tenant in common with <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> and after the reverſion is granted to a ſtranger, and <hi>A, B, C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> atturn; this is no good atturnment to perfect the grant of the reverſion, for <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> cannot atturn, and the atturnment of <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> for the King and themſelves is not good.</p>

               <p>In all caſes for the moſt part where atturnment is needfull, the <note place="margin">Co. 6. 68. 9. 84. ſuper Litt. 315.</note> tenant whether he be tenant in fee ſimple, for life, yeares, by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115677:139"/> Elegit, or as executor untill debts be paid, ſhall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to atturn. And albeit the tenant be an infant, and come to the land by purchaſe or deſcent, yet may he be compelled to atturn, but then in this caſe his atturnment ſhall not prejudice him, for when he is of full age he may diſclaim or ſay he doth hold by leſſe ſervices.</p>
               <p>If there be tenant in tail of a reverſion, and he grant this over to <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 316. 318.</note> a ſtranger; in this caſe the tenant in poſſeſſion may be compelled to atturne. But if the reverſion upon the eſtate of the tenant in tail, or upon the eſtate of the tenant in tail after poſſibility of iſſue extinct be granted, ſuch a tenant may may not be compelled to atturn; and yet ſuch a tenant may atturn <hi>gratis</hi> if he will. And the aſſignee of the eſtate of ſuch a tenant in taile after poſſibility &amp;c. is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to atturn. And if one make a gift in tail, the remainder in fee, and the Seigniory, or a rent charge iſſuing out of the land, is granted in ſee by fine; in this caſe the tenant in tail may bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to atturn.</p>
               <p>In al caſes for the moſt part where atturnment is not needful, there <note place="margin">Co. 6. 68. ſuper Litt. 318.</note> is no means to compell the tenant to atturn. And therefore the tenant cannot be compelled to atturn to him that comes to a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or remainder by eſcheat, forfeiture &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If one grant his reverſion of land in Mortmain without a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 318. 3. 86.</note> the tenant may not be compelled to atturn untill there bee a licence had from the King.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is a generall rule, that when the grant by fine is defeaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 318. 3. 86.</note> there the tenant ſhall not be compelled to atturne. As if an infant levy a fine, this is defeaſible by writ of Error during his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, and therefore the tenant ſhall not be compelled to atturn. So if the land be holden in ancient demeſne, and he in the reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on levieth a fine of the reverſion at the Common Law; the tenant ſhall not be compelled to atturn, becauſe the eſtate that paſſeth is reverſable by a writ of deceit.</p>
               <p>If the grant be abſolute, and the atturnment be on condition; <note place="margin">10. How an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnment ſhall enure and be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Litt. 309. 310. 297. See before.</note> yet this ſhall enure according to the grant. So if the atturnment be but to part of the things, or part of the time granted; this ſhall enure to perfect the grant for all. So if the atturnment be made but to one of the grantees, it ſhall enure to the reſt. So if the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnment be made to the particular tenant, it ſhall enure to him in the remainder to perfect his eſtate alſo.</p>
               <p>If the eſtate of the tenant be with a priviledge annexed, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 320.</note> impeachment of waſt, or the like, and the tenant atturn gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally without any ſaving of his priviledge, if the atturnment bee <hi>gratis</hi> and voluntary, whether it bee an atturnement in law or in deed; this ſhall not enure to extinguiſh his priviledge: but if the atturnment be made by the compulſion of a writ in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115677:140"/> and without this ſaving, he hath loſt his priviledge for ever.</p>
               <p>If a reverſion &amp;c. be granted to two ſeverall men one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 310.</note> and he that hath the latter grant get the atturnment of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his grant before the other; in this caſe this ſhall enure to perfect the latter, and the firſt grant now cannot be made good.</p>
               <p>If a reverſion be granted to a man and woman unmaried, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore atturnment made they entermary, and then the tenant atturn; <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 310.</note> in this caſe they ſhall have the eſtate by moities.</p>
               <p>An atturnment as to the party grantor ſhall have relation to the <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 310.</note>

But in reſpect of a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it ſhall not relate at all. And therefore if two deeds be of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion at ſeverall times, and hee whoſe deed was made laſt gets atturnment firſt, the reverſion doth paſſe to him, and though the other get atturnment afterwards, yet this will not help him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and albeit the former grant of the reverſion be in fee, and the latter for life onely, yet the law will be allone in both caſe.</p>

And this is ſometimes by ſome ſpeciall Act of Parliament enabling them ſo to doe. And hence it is alſo that a tenant in tail may make leaſes for three lives or twenty one years. And ſometimes it is by ſome ſpeciall power or authority that is given or reſerved by and to the party himſelf that had the ſee ſimple in him, or given to ſome other to doe it in his name, and leaſes thus made may bee good. And therefore if any Act of Parliament enable a tenant in tail, or a tenant for life to make leaſes for three lives, or twenty one years, leaſes that are ſo made in purſuit of that authority, are good. And if a man be ſeiſed of land in fee, and convey it to the uſe of himſelf for life, or in tail with divers remainders over with a proviſo that it ſhall be lawfull for him or any ſuch tenant in tail to make leaſes for twenty one years; in this caſe he or they may make ſuch leaſes and they will be good. But in both theſe caſes care muſt be had to purſue the authority ſtrictly, <hi>i.</hi> that the leaſes made be according to the power and direction given by the ſtatute or proviſo, for if it differ and vary ever ſo little from the ſenſe and meaning of the ſame; the leaſe will not be good. And therefore in the caſe before of a power to make leaſes for twenty one years, if the party make more leaſes for twenty one yeares at one time then one, they are all void but the firſt, becauſe it is againſt the intent of the parties, though it be not againſt the words. And ſo if the power be to make leaſes for three lives; he cannot by this make a leaſe for ninety nine yeares if three lives ſo long live. But if the power be thus, Provided &amp;c. that he may make any leaſe in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115677:142"/> or reverſion, ſo as it doe not exceed the number of three lives or twenty one years; in this caſe a leaſe may be made for ninety nine years if three lives live ſo long. But where uſes are raiſed by way of covenant, and in the deed there is a proviſo that the covenant or for divers good conſiderations may make leaſes for years; in this caſe this power is void, and therefore no leaſe can bee made hereupon: neither will any averment help in this caſe. And if a man have a <note place="margin">Averment.</note> letter of Atturney, or other authority to make leaſes for another, and doe make them accordingly; ſuch leaſes are good. But herein alſo caution muſt be had of three things: 1. That the authority be <note place="margin">Co. 9. 76.</note> good. 2. That he that is the Deputy or Atturney doe purſue the authority ſtrictly. 3. That he doe it in the name of his maſter, and not in his own name.</p>
               <p>A leaſe made for a thouſand days, moneths, or weeks, is as good <note place="margin">Co. 6. 72. 14 H. 8. 13.</note>

But if the agreement be that ſuch a writing ſhall be made, or that a leaſe ſhall be made of ſuch a thing between them and put in writing, ſo that the agreement hath reference to the writing, and implieth an intent not to perfect the agreement till the writing be made; in this caſe the leaſe is not a perfect leaſe untill the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be made.</p>
               <p>Albeit the moſt uſuall and proper making of a Leaſe is by the <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 5. F. N. B. 270. e. Br.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115677:143"/> therefore a Leaſe may be made by the word, Give, Betake, or the like. The word <hi>Locavit</hi> alſo is a good word.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115677:143"/> a poſſible contingent precedent before it begin in poſſeſſion or intereſt, or upon a limitation or condition ſubſequent: but in caſe when it is to be reduced to a certainty upon a contingent prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the contingent muſt happen in the lives of the parties. And albeit there appear no certainty of years in the leaſe, yet if by reference to a certainty it may bee made certaine it is ſufficient. <hi>Id certum est quod certum reddi poteſt.</hi> As for examples, if <hi>A</hi> ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of lands in fee grant to <hi>B,</hi> that when <hi>B</hi> ſhall pay to <hi>A</hi> twenty <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 45.

But if the ſecond leaſe be made by word of mouth it is otherwiſe, for a reverſion and a rent in this caſe will not paſſe without deed, and therefore a grant by word doth not paſſe them.

And if a Biſhop ſuffer an annuity to be recovered againſt him by a pretence of title of preſcription on a Judgment after a verdict or confeſſion, or a Parſon in ſuch a caſe pray in aide of the Patron and ſo ſuffer an annuity to be recovered; this will not bind the ſucceſſor.

But they may not grant any new office nor yet adde any new fee to the old offices. And therefore if a Biſhop grant an annuity <hi>pro conſilio impenſo &amp; impendendo</hi> where none was before; this will not bind the ſucceſſor. And yet if there be an old fee, and there is a new fee added to it; in this caſe it ſeems it is good for the old fee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be void for the new fee. Neither may they grant their offices otherwiſe then they have been granted. And therefore where the ancient grants of the office have been to one; it cannot be now granted to two. And where the ancient grants have been to two jointly, they may not be now granted in remainder one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Neither may the grants of theſe offices be longer then for

               <p>But here note that albeit in all theſe caſes of leaſes and grants <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 45. 329. 3. 59. 10. 59. 11 73. 78. 5. 5.</note> not warranted by the Statutes aforeſaid the Statutes ſay the leaſes <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſhall be void, yet this is to be underſtood as againſt the ſucceſſors and not againſt the leſſors themſelves, for the leaſes are good ſo long as the leſſors live, or at leaſt ſo long as they continue in the place. And therefore if ſuch a leaſe be made by a Deane and Chapter or other Corporation aggregate; it is good as againſt the Deane or other head of the Corporation, ſo long as he doth continue in his place. And if a Biſhop make any leaſe or other grant not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> or a Deane and Chapter, Maſter and Fellowes of a Colledge or the like make leaſes not warranted by the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 10. theſe leaſes are good againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves albeit they are void againſt their ſucceſſors. So as if a private Act of Parliament doth entaile land upon a man, and appoint him what eſtates he ſhall make, and that if he make any other eſtates they ſhall be void; in this caſe they ſhall not be void as to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in taile himſelfe that doth make them.</p>
               <p>Leaſes of Benefices with cure are no longer good then the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Stat. 13 El. cap. 20.</note> is reſident.</p>

So if one make a feoffment in fee, or leaſe for life, &amp;c. and doe not make livery of ſeiſin and ſo perfect the eſtate; the feoffee or leſſee hath only an eſtate at will. But if a bargaine and ſale be made of land, and the ſame is void, or a Corporation grant land, and the grant is void; by this there is no leaſe at will made.</p>
               <p>Leaſes for lives or yeares are of three natures, ſome be good in <note place="margin">9. Where a leaſe for life or years ſhall be void <hi>ipſo facto</hi> by the death of the leſſor or by other meanes. Or not, but voidable by entry &amp;c. And how.</note>

And of ſuch as be good in law, ſome be good at the common law, as leaſes made by tenant in fee ſimple notwithſtanding they be for longer time then three lives or twenty one yeares; ſome by act of Parliament, as leaſes made by tenant in taile, leaſes made by a Biſhop ſeiſed in fee in the right of his Church alone without the Chapter, leaſes made by a man ſeiſed in fee ſimple or fee taile of land, in the right of his wife together with his wife, for twenty one yeares, or three lives according to the Statutes. And of ſuch leaſes as be void alſo, ſome are void at the common law, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>in preſenti,</hi> as in the caſes before of leaſes for yeares that have no certainty in them, or leaſes for lives made without livery of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115677:149"/> ſeiſin, and the like. And ſome are void in <hi>futuro,</hi> as if a tenant in taile make a leaſe for yeares warranted or not warranted by the Statute, and after die without iſſue; this leaſe is void as to him in reverſion or remainder: <hi>Ceſſante ſtatu primitivo ceſſat derivativus.</hi> So if a Prebend, Parſon, or Vicar make a leaſe for yeares not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Statutes; this is void by the death of the leſſor, and the ſucceſſor need not make any entry or claime to avoid it. So if a tenant for life make a leaſe for yeares and after die; in this caſe the leaſe for yeares is void. And therefore in all theſe and ſuch like caſes no acceptance of rent after will affirme ſuch leaſes. But <note place="margin">Acceptance.</note> otherwiſe it is in caſes of leaſes for yeares made by Biſhops albeit they be confirmed by Deane and Chapter; and of leaſes made by Deanes and Chapters, or tenants in taile as to their ſucceſſors and iſſues when the leaſes are not warranted by the Statutes: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is alſo in the caſe of leaſes for life made by theſe or any of the former leſſors, for in all caſes of leaſes for life it muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by entry &amp;c. and therefore ſuch leaſes are not void but voidable. <hi>viz.</hi> The leaſes of Biſhops and Deanes after their death by their ſucceſſors and that by the Statute law, and the leaſes of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in taile by their iſſues after their death, and that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. And in theſe and ſuch like caſes the acceptance of the <note place="margin">Acceptance.</note> rent by the iſſue or ſucceſſor will make good the leaſe at leaſt for their time.</p>
               <p>If a leaſe be made for yeares on condition that upon ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent <note place="margin">Co. 3. 65.</note> it ſhall be void; in this caſe ſo ſoone as the thing doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the leaſe is void <hi>ipſo facto</hi> without any reentry &amp;c.

So if tenant in taile make a leaſe for yeares and die without iſſue his wife enceint with a ſonne, and he in reverſion enter, and after the ſonne (being heire to the entaile) is borne; in this caſe the leaſe which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore avoided by him in reverſion if it be ſuch a leaſe as is warranted by the Statute is good againſt the iſſue in taile, and therefore is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived againe. So if the King make a gift in taile to <hi>W</hi> to hold by Knights ſervice, and <hi>W</hi> doth make a leaſe to <hi>A</hi> for thirty yeares reſerving rent, and then <hi>W</hi> dieth his ſonne and heire of full age; in this caſe as to the King this leaſe is void, but after livery ſued out the leſſee may enter againe, and if the iſſue accept the rent the leaſe is affirmed. So if tenant in taile make a leaſe not warranted by the Statute and die, and his heire is in ward; in this caſe the Gardian in the behalfe of the heire may avoid the leaſe during the wardſhip, but afterwards the heire may affirme it againe if he accept of the rent. So if tenant in ſee ſimple take a wife, and then make a leaſe for years and dieth, and the wife is endowed, ſhe ſhall avoid the leaſe for her eſtate, but after her death the leaſe will be in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. But if the Patron grant the next avoidance, and after the Parſon, Patron and Ordinary before the Statutes had made a leaſe of the Glebe for years, and after the Parſon had died, and the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the next avoidance had preſented a Clerke to the Church who had been admitted, inſtituted and inducted, and had died within the terme, and the Patron had preſented a new Clerke to the Church who had been admitted, inſtituted and inducted; in this caſe the leaſe had not revived againe. No more then if a feme co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert levy a fine alone, and the husband doth enter and avoid the fine, the eſtate ſhall revive againſt the wife after his death, for it is avoided as to her alſo as well as to the husband by his entry.

And in ſome caſes it is avoidable only at ſome times, and in ſome caſes it is avoidable at all times: as for examples, an Infant if he grant by fine muſt avoid it during his minority if he live to be of full age, otherwiſe he himſelfe or any other ſhall never <note place="margin">Infant.</note> avoid it. But if he grant by deed, this may be avoided at any time by himſelfe, his heires, executors, or adminiſtrators, or his Gardian in his right as the caſe is.

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of an Exchange.</head>
               <p>AN Exchange is the mutuall grant of equall intereſts the one in <note place="margin">1. Exchange or Eſchange. <hi>Quid.</hi>
                  </note> exchange for the other. Or it is, where a man is ſeiſed or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed <note place="margin">Terms of the law tit.

And in this there is a doble grant, for each of them doth grant that which is his to the other.</p>
               <p>This manner of conveyance (which heretofore was very frequent) is ſometimes made by word without any writing: and ſometimes <note place="margin">* Co. ſuper Lit. 50. Perk. Sect. 253.</note> it is made by deed or in writing: and which way ſoever it be made it muſt be made by this word Exchange, which is a word ſo appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115677:152"/> to this thing as the word Frankmariage is to a gift in Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariage, neither of which can be made or deſcribed by any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution.</p>
               <p>The fruit and effect of an exchange is, that it doth give the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt <note place="margin">Co. 4. 121. 15 E. 4. 3. 9 E. 4. 21. Bro.

The effect and fruit of it.</note> according to the agreement. And if the exchange be of lands or tenements of any eſtate of Inheritance or freehold whether it be by word or deed, it hath a condition and a warranty in law incident and annexed to it as a thing made by the word Exchange and <hi>tacite</hi> implied in every grant of exchange: A condition, to give a reentry upon all the land given in exchange if he be put out of all or part <note place="margin">Condition.</note> of the land taken in exchange, and a warranty, to enable him to vouch and to recover over in value ſo much of his own land againe <note place="margin">Warranty.</note> given in exchange as ſhall be recovered from him of the land taken in exchange if he be ſued for it: So that upon every exchange either party if he be put out of or loſe by action the land he taketh in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change hath a double remedy againſt the other, and yet this remedy doth goe only in the privity and ſhall not goe to an aſſignee: As if <note place="margin">Aſſignee.</note> 
                  <hi>A</hi> exchange land with <hi>B</hi> and <hi>B</hi> be put out of all or part of the land upon a title paramount by a recovery in a reall action or otherwiſe, in this caſe <hi>B</hi> may either enter upon his owne land againe which he gave in exchange, or elſe if it be in an action brought he may vouch <hi>A</hi> upon the warranty in law, and ſhall recover as much in value againſt him of the land he gave as he hath loſt of the land he tooke in exchange. But if <hi>B</hi> alien his land taken in exchange to <hi>C</hi> and <hi>C</hi> be put out of all or part of the land upon a title paramount, <hi>C</hi> in this caſe can neither enter upon the land given to <hi>A</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change upon the condition in law, nor vouch <hi>A</hi> to warranty and recover over in value upon the warranty in law. And yet <hi>A</hi> in this caſe ſhall have the like remedy againſt <hi>C</hi> the alienee upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and warranty both as he had againſt <hi>B.</hi> But if <hi>A</hi> himſelfe implead <hi>C</hi> for the land he gave to <hi>B</hi> in exchange, <hi>C</hi> may make uſe of this warranty in law by way of Rebutter againſt <hi>A.</hi> And in all theſe caſes where one of the parties is put out of all or part of the <note place="margin">Rebutter.</note> land or out of part of the eſtate by entry, and the other party en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the others land upon the condition in law, he may enter upon the whole land and avoid the whole exchange: but if he be impleaded for a part only or for the whole, and a part only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from him; in this caſe he ſhall recover ſo much in value of the other land only as he hath loſt and no more: As if an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change be of three acres for three acres, and after one of the parties is put out of one of the acres by the entry of a ſtranger; in this caſe he may enter upon the whole three acres he had given in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and ſo avoid the whole exchange if he will. And if <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> be Jointenants for life and the fee ſimple to the heires of <hi>A</hi> and <hi>A</hi> exchange this land with <hi>C</hi> in fee, and then die, and <hi>B</hi> enter and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115677:152"/> avoid the exchange for his life (as he may) in this caſe <hi>C</hi> may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the whole exchange and enter upon his owne three acres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. So if he in reverſion diſſeiſe his tenant for life, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the land, and after the tenant for life enter; in this caſe the other party may defeate the whole exchange. But in this caſe of an exchange of three acres for three acres, if one of the acres were gained by diſſeiſin, and the diſſeiſee bring an action and doth recover it againſt the diſſeiſor, in this caſe if he vouch over the other party to the exchange, he ſhall recover ſo much in value only of the three acres he gave in exchange as the acre he hath loſt and no more.</p>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a ſeigniory by homage and fealty or the like which is not valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 259, 260. 258.</note> may be exchanged for land, rent, or any other ſuch like thing. So may a ſeigniory by divine ſervice. But a ſeigniory in frankalmoigne cannot be exchanged with any but the tenant of the land that doth hold by the tenure. And houſes, manors, lands, rents, commons, ſeigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories, reverſions, and the like may be exchanged in fee ſimple, fee tail, for life, or years. So that an exchange may be of an Inheritance for an Inheritance, of a franktenement for a franktenemant, and of chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells reall for chattells reall.</p>

So if I grant a rent charge iſſuing out of my land in exchange to <hi>I S</hi> for an acre of his land &amp;c. this is a good exchange. So if I have a rent iſſuing out of the land of <hi>I S</hi> and I grant this to <hi>I K</hi> in exchange for land or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rent; this exchange is good when the tenant hath atturned to the grant of the rent. So if one have a rent out of my land in fee, &amp; I have the land in fee &amp; I grant the land in exchange for the rent, it ſeems this is a good exchange. But if one grant me a Manor or land, &amp; I in exchange for the ſame Manor or land grant unto him a rent <hi>de novo</hi> iſſuing out the ſame land or Mannor, this cannot take effect as an Exchange. So if one releaſe his Eſtovers that hee hath in <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 266. Fitz. Eſchange 16.</note> ſuch a Wood, and deliver the Releaſe in Exchange for land given

Sect. 268, 269.</note> If I be ſeiſed of lands to which <hi>I S</hi> hath a right of action, and I give to him other land for a releaſe of his right; this is a good exchange.

So if <hi>I S</hi> give his Manor of <hi>A</hi> to <hi>T K</hi> in exchange for his Manor of <hi>B</hi> or for his Manor of <hi>C</hi> &amp; he enter upon one of theſe Manors, and <hi>T K</hi> enter upon the Manor of <hi>A;</hi> this exchange is good.

And yet if I grant to another the Manor of <hi>A</hi> for the Manor of <hi>B</hi> which he is to have after his fathers death by deſcent, it ſeems this exchange is void. 2. There needs no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of poſſeſſion, for a releaſe of rent, eſtovers, or right of land for land is good. 3. The things exchanged need not to be of one nature ſo as they concerne lands or tenements, for land may be exchanged for rent, common, or any other inheritance which doth concerne lands or tenements, or ſpirituall for temporall things, as
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115677:154"/> tithes; a tenure by divine ſervice for land or a temporall ſeigniory. But annuities and ſuch like things which charge the perſon only and doe not concerne lands or tenements, or goods and chattels, cannot be exchanged for land.</p>
               <p>The third thing required in a good exchange is, that it be made <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 244. Co. ſuper Lit. 51, 52. Lit. Sect. 62. Co. 9. 14. Perk Sect. 247, 248, 249, 250. 246.</note> in that manner and order that law doth require: wherein theſe <note place="margin">3. In reſpect of the manner of the making of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. And where it ſhall be good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deed or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot.</note> things are to be known. 1. That if all or part of the things whereof the exchange is made doe lie in ſeverall counties: or if all or part of the things whereof the exchange is be ſuch as lie in grant and not in livery, albeit it be in the ſame county: in theſe caſes the exchange muſt be made by deed indented in writing. But where the exchange is of lands, and of lands lying in the ſame county, albeit it be of any eſtate of inheritance or free hold, yet it may be by word of mouth without writing. And ſo alſo may it be when the things exchanged doe lie in divers counties, when the exchange is made only for a terme of years. And therefore if an exchange be made between <hi>I S</hi> and <hi>T K</hi> of lands lying in one and the ſame county in fee, or for life, it may be by word of mouth: but if all or part of the lands of <hi>I S</hi> lie in one county, and all or part of the lands of <hi>T K</hi> doe lie in another county, the exchange muſt be made by deed indented. If an exchange be made of rent for land, and the land out of which the rent is iſſuing and the land given in exchange for it doe both lie in one county; this exchange cannot be good without deed. So if an exchange be made of the reverſion of an acre of land for three ſhillings of rent iſſuing out of another acre of land, and both acres are in one county; this exchange muſt be made by deed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented or it will not be good. So if an exchange be made of an acre of land and a rent out of another acre for another acre of land and common for three beaſts, and all is in one and the ſame county, this exchange muſt be by deed indented, or it will not be good. But if I be ſeiſed of a Manor to which I have common appendant or appurtenant, and <hi>T K</hi> is ſeiſed of another Manor to which he hath a villaine regardant, and both the Manors are in one county, an exchange may be made of theſe Manors by word of mouth without writing, and the common and villaine will paſſe as incidents well enough. And yet if <hi>I S</hi> hath an office whereunto land doth belong and <hi>T K</hi> hath rent iſſuing out of the land of a ſtranger and all the land is in one county and the office is to be uſed and occupied in the ſame county; if theſe things be exchanged it muſt be by deed indented. 2. The word [Eſchange] or [Exchange] <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 50, 51, Perk. Sect. 252, 253. 9 E. 4. 21. Fitz. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. 13.</note> muſt be had and uſed between the parties in the making of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. As <hi>I</hi> grant to you white acre To have and to hold to you and your heires in exchange for blacke acre. And in conſideration hereof you grant to me and my heires blacke acre in exchange for
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115677:154"/> white acre, for this word is ſo individually requiſite as it cannot be ſupplied by any other word, neither will any averment that it was in exchange helpe in this caſe. And therefore if <hi>A</hi> by deed inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted give to <hi>B</hi> an acre of land in fee ſimple, or for life, and by the ſame deed <hi>B</hi> doth give to <hi>A</hi> another acre of land in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this cannot enure as an exchange; And therefore if no livery of ſeiſin ſo as it may take effect by way of Grant, it is utterly void. <note place="margin">Livery of ſeiſin.</note> But by this meanes lands may be granted from one to another, for there needs no livery of ſeiſin. So if an exchange be made by words betweene two of lands in one county, and before their entry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures are made betweene them of the ſame lands without words of exchange, and no livery of ſeiſin is made; this ſhall not paſſe by way of exchange. And yet it hath been held by ſome that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatio,</hi> or ſome other word of like effect may ſupply this word exchange. 3. That if any rent, reverſion, ſeigniory, or the like <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 259. 263. 289. 276.</note> be granted by either party, that then the tenant doe atturne to the grant, for that atturnment is requiſite in this caſe. And yet in <note place="margin">Atturnment.</note> the caſe of the grant of land in poſſeſſion in exchange no livery of ſeiſin is needfull. Neither is it needfull that either party to the exchange come to the thing given to him in exchange by the ſame <note place="margin">Livery of ſeiſin.</note> meane and manner of aſſurance: for if leſſee for life of one acre give another acre to his leſſor in taile in exchange for a releaſe from him of that acre, To have and to hold in taile in like manner, this is a good exchange.</p>
               <p>An exchange may be made to take effect in <hi>futuro</hi> as well as in <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 265.</note> 
                  <hi>preſenti,</hi> for if an exchange be made betweene me and <hi>T K</hi> that after the Feaſt of Eaſter <hi>T K</hi> ſhall have my Manor of Dale in exchange for his Manor of Sale, this is a good exchange.</p>
               <p>If an exchange be made in writing of land, and it doth limit and expreſſe no eſtate that either party ſhall have in the thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, <note place="margin">19 H. 6. 27. Perk. Sect. 275.</note> yet this is a good exchange. But if an eſtate for life be limited expreſſely to one, and no expreſſe eſtate is limited to the other; this is not a good exchange, as ſhall be ſhewed in the next place.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing required in a good exchange is equality of <note place="margin">Fitz. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change 15. Lit. Sect. 64, 65. Co. ſuper Lit. 50, 51. Perk. Sect. 276.</note> eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> that either party have the like kind of eſtate of the <note place="margin">4 In reſpect of the quality or equality of the eſtates or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> thing exchanged, ſo that if one have an eſtate in fee ſimple the other have ſo likewiſe, and ſo for other eſtates. For if the one grant that the other ſhall have his land in fee ſimple for the land which he hath of the other in fee taile: or that the one ſhall have in the one land fee taile, and the other in the other land but for terme of life: or that the one ſhall have in the one land fee taile generall, and the other in the other land fee taile ſpeciall: or that the one ſhall have in the one land for life, and the other in the other
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115677:155"/> land but for yeares; theſe exchanges are void and cannot take effect as exchanges. <note n="m" place="margin">Perk. Sect. 283.</note> And therefore if the Lord releaſe to his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant his ſervices in taile in exchange for other lands given to the Lord in exchange in taile alſo; this exchange is void, for by this releaſe made by the Lord the ſervices are gone for ever. <note n="n" place="margin">Perk. Sect. 275. Finches ley 27.</note> So if te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for his owne life exchange with him that is tenant for life of another; this is not a good exchange. (And by the ſame reaſon it ſhould ſeeme if leſſee for twenty yeares of his land exchange with another for other land for forty yeares, that this ſhould not be a good exchange.) <note n="o" place="margin">Perk. Sect. 276.</note> But if leſſee for life be of an acre of land and he give another acre of land to his leſſor in fee taile in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for a releaſe of all his right in the acre that he holdeth for terme of his life, To hold to him and the heires of his body en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred; this is a good exchange. <note n="p" place="margin">Co. 11. 80.</note> Or if tenant for his owne life exchange with him that is tenant in taile after poſſibility of iſſue extinct; this exchange is good. <note n="q" place="margin">Perk. Sect. 275. 19 H. 6. 27.</note> And yet if an eſtate for life be expreſſed to the one party upon the exchange, and no eſtate is expreſſed to the other party; it is ſaid that this exchange is not good, and yet where no eſtate is expreſſed the party ſhall have an eſtate for his owne life.</p>
               <p>But in theſe caſes it is not neceſſary that the parties to the <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 51. Perk. Sect. 289. Lit. Sect. 65. Perk. Sect. 280, 281.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Husband and wife. Tenant in tail.</note> exchange be ſeiſed of an equall eſtate at the time of the exchange made, for if tenant in taile or husband in right of his wife exchange their land in fee ſimple with another for lands he hath in fee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this is a good exchange untill it be avoided by the iſſue or the wife. <note n="r" place="margin">Idem.</note> Neither is it neceſſary that both eſtates be in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for one may grant an acre in poſſeſſion in exchange for an acre in reverſion, and this exchange is good. <note n="s" place="margin">Idem.</note> Neither is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that there be an equality in the value or quantity of the lands exchanged, for if the land of one of the parties be worth one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound and the land of the other but tenne pound, or the land of one of the parties be one hundred acres and the land of the other but tenne acres, if the eſtates given be equall, the exchange is good. <note n="t" place="margin">Idem.</note> Neither is equality in the quality or manner of the eſtates requiſite. For if two Jointenants be in fee of an acre of land and they grant that acre to another in exchange for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lands To have and to hold a moity to one of them and his heires, and a moity to the other and his heires, which is an eſtate in common: or two men give lands in exchange to <hi>A</hi> and his heires for lands from <hi>A</hi> to them two and their heires, albeit the one party hath a joynt eſtate and the other a ſole eſtate, yet the exchange is good. The like law is if the land of one of the parties be of a defeaſible title and the land of the other of an undefeaſible title, this exchange is good till it be avoided.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:115677:155"/>
               <p>The fifth and laſt thing required in a good exchange is, that there <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 50, 51. Co. 1. 98. 105. Perk. Sect. 284. 286. 292. 289.</note> be an execution and perfection of the exchange by entry or claime <note place="margin">5. In reſpect of the execution of it.</note> in the life time of the parties, <hi>viz.</hi> That both the parties to the ſame exchange do enter into the things taken in exchange, if they be ſuch things as they may enter into, for untill the exchange be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by entry, or the like, the parties thereunto have no freehold in deed or in law in the things exchanged, albeit the ſame things do lie in one County: And if either of the parties die before he enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lands by him taken in exchange; hereby the whole exchange is become void, if his heir will; but if one of the parties enter, he ſhall not firſt begin to avoid the exchange. But if the parties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at any time during their lives it is ſufficient, unleſſe the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be before deveſted by an elder title, as by entry for a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on broken, entry by a diſſeiſee or his heir, or the like, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted again before the entry. As if an exchange be had betweene two of land, and before their entry by force of the exchange they are, or one of them is diſſeiſed of the land exchanged, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor die ſeiſed thereof, and then they enter according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and put out the heir of the diſſeiſor, this ſhall not be ſaid to be an execution of the exchange, but if the diſſeiſee have recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame land againſt the heir of the diſſeiſor by writ of entry, and have execution, then he may execute the exchange by entry. And in caſe where a reverſion, rent, or ſeigniory is granted in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, it muſt be perfected and executed by the atturnment of the tenant in the life time of the parties, otherwiſe the exchange is not good; but in this caſe after atturnment is made, it ſeems the exchange is perfect without any entry or claim.</p>
               <p>If two Parſons exchange their Churches, and reſigne them into <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 257.</note> the Biſhops hands, this is not a perfect exchange untill they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted; and therefore if either of them die before they be both inducted, the exchange is void.</p>
               <p>Where a deed ſhall take effect as an exchange, there muſt be all <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 255, 256. Fitz. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change 14. Perk. Sect. 272.</note> the conditions before mentioned in the caſe. And yet note that <note place="margin">4. When a deed ſhall take effect as an exchange. Or not.</note> where one thing is granted for another in the nature of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and for ſome of the cauſes aforeſaid, the things cannot paſſe by way of exchange, there they may paſſe notwithſtanding by way of grant, and the deed may take effect to other purpoſes, albeit it may not enure and take effect as an exchange. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if two be ſeiſed of ſeverall acres of land, and the one of them by deed doth give his acre to the other, and the other his acre to him without any word of exchange, and each of them doth make livery of ſeiſin to the other; in this caſe albeit the acres will not paſſe by way of exchange, yet will they paſſe by way of grant. And in this caſe if no livery of ſeiſin be made, either of them ſhall hold the lands granted at will only. And in like manner it is if two
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115677:156"/> agree to exchange land, and after each of them levy a fine or make a feoffment of the land to other; by this the land will paſſe each to other, but not by way of exchange. So if <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> his wife, and <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> his wife agree to exchange lands, and <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> enter into the land they are to have in exchange, and then they doe make a feoffment of their own land unto <hi>C</hi> and his father, and not to <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> his wife; this ſhall not enure as an exchange, and therefore <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> may enter upon their own land again, but the feoffment is good. And if one aſſign a woman her dower in exchange for land; this ſhall not take effect as an exchange, but it ſhall enure to be a good aſſignment of dower.</p>
               <p>If two doe exchange land by deed, and limit no eſtates, this ſhall <note place="margin">19 H. 6. 27. Perk. Sect. 275.</note>

               <p>If an exchange be made between two men of two acres of land <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 251.</note> by deed, and in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> it is ſet down that each of them ſhal have the acres given in exchange with divers other acres not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the premiſſes, this addition ſhall be taken as ſurpluſage, and the exchange ſhall be good for the two acres. See more in <hi>Expoſition of Deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If after an exchange is made before or after the parties enter, all, <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 286. Co. 4. 122. Perk. Sect. 299. Bro. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change 12.</note>

But if after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is perfect, one of the parties doe enter upon the land he doth give in exchange, this doth not make void the exchange, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may the other party hereupon enter upon the land he doth give in exchange, but he may have an aſſiſe, or an action of Treſpaſſe againſt the other. And yet if an exchange of a common for a way, <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 299.</note> or a rent, or the like, if the one party deny the common, it hath been ſaid the other party may deny the way or the rent. <hi>Sed quaere.</hi>

               <p>If an exchange be made of fee between two of a Manor, whereof <note place="margin">Bro. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change 8. Perk.

As if one be ſeiſed of white acre, and he exchange white acre and black acre (which is none of his) with another for two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acres, this ſhall continue for a good exchange, and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided untill he that hath right to black acre doth evict him that hath it in exchange.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Of a Surrender.</head>
               <p>A Surrender properly taken is the yeelding or delivering up of <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 337.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Surrender, <hi>Quid.</hi>

But it is ſometimes improperly applied to other things. He that doth ſurrender is called the ſurrendror, and he to whom it <note place="margin">Surrendror. Surrendree.</note> is made is called the ſurrendree.</p>
               <p>And there be three kinds of ſurrender, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſurrender proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">2. Quotuplex.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 337, 338 Co. 6. 69. Plow. 106, 107. Weſt Symb. 1. part. lib. 2. chap. 460.</note> taken at the Common law. 2. A ſurrender by cuſtome of lands holden by cuſtome or of cuſtomary eſtates, whereof we ſpeak not here. 3. A ſurrender improperly taken, as of a deed, or grant of a rent-charge, of a patent, and of lands in fee ſimple to the King. The ſurrender properly taken is of two ſorts: 1. Expreſſe or in deed, which is when it is done by apt words, and the expreſſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the parties. 2. In law or implied, which is when it is wrought by conſequent and operation of law, or when the law doth interpret or enure ſomething done to another intent to make a ſurrender of it. And in the firſt caſe it is ſometimes by word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſometimes by writing. And when it is by writing, it is ſaid to be an inſtrument teſtifying by apt words that the particular tenant of the lands or tenements for life or years doth conſent and agree that he which hath the next and immediate remainder or reverſion thereof ſhall alſo have the particular eſtate of the ſame in poſſeſſion, and that he yeeldeth the ſame unto him.</p>
               <p>The fruit and effect of a ſurrender is, that it doth paſſe the eſtate <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 338. Co. 1. 96. Bro. ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 47. Perk Sect. 591.</note>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115677:157"/> ſaid to have continuance ſtill. And therefore if tenant for life grant a rent-charge, and after doth ſurrender his land; in this caſe the rent-charge ſhall continue notwithſtanding the ſurrender. So if leſſee for life make a leaſe for years rendring rent, and the leſſee for life ſurrender his eſtate; in this caſe albeit the primitive eſtate <note place="margin">Extinguiſhment.</note> for life be yeelded up, yet the derivative eſtate for years ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue notwithſtanding, but the ſurrendree ſhall not have the rent reſerved upon the leaſe for years. So if leſſee for life or years break a covenant with his leſſor, and after ſurrender his eſtate to him, his <note place="margin">Covenant.</note> breach of covenant is not hereby ſalved, for the leſſor may have an action of covenant ſtill notwithſtanding the ſurrender. And if one ſeiſed of land grant a rent out of it in fee, and this rent is extended <note place="margin">Co. 8. 145. 2. 39. Bro. Sur. 42.</note> on a ſtatute or granted for leſſe time to another, and then the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee doth ſurrender the deed of the grant of the rent to the tenant of the land; in this caſe the rent ſhall continue as to him that hath execution and the grantee. And if one make a leaſe for years ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring rent, and the leſſee ſurrender his eſtate to the leſſor; hereby the rent is extinct: but if the leſſor grant the rent to a ſtranger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſurrender <hi>contrà.</hi> And if one leaſe for years, and the leſſee let parcel of his term to his leſſor rendring rent, and after the leſſee ſurrender his whole eſtate; in this caſe it ſeems the rent is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>If leſſee for life or years take a new leaſe of him in reverſion of <note place="margin">14 H. 8. 15. Plow. 194. Dier 28.

And by what means an eſtate ſhall be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in law. Or not. By acceptance and taking of a new eſtate.</note> or years; this is a ſurrender in law of the firſt leaſe. As if leſſee for his own or anothers life in poſſeſſion or reverſion take a new leaſe for years; Or a leſſee for forty years take a new leaſe for fifty years; the firſt leaſe in both theſe caſes is ſurrendred. And this rule hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, albeit the ſecond leaſe be for a leſſe time the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt, as if leſſee <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 617. Co. 5. 11.</note> for life accept a leaſe for years, or leſſee for twenty years accept a leaſe for two years. And albeit the ſecond leaſe be voidable, as being <note place="margin">Fitz. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render 3. Co. ſuper Lit. 218. 37 H. 6. 17.</note> made upon condition, as if leſſee for twenty years take a new leaſe for twenty years upon condition that if ſuch a thing happen the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond leaſe ſhall be void, and the thing doe after happen; in this caſe both theſe leaſes are become void: As where the leſſor doth grant the reverſion to the leſſee upon condition, and after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is broken. Or if the ſecond leaſe be made by tenant in tail, <note place="margin">Dier 140, 141.</note> or the like: as if a man make a leaſe for years of land, and then make a feoffment to another of the land, and then take back an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to him and his wife of the land, and then make a new leaſe to the leſſee for ten years; this is a ſurrender in law of the firſt leaſe: But if the ſecond leaſe be meerly void, then it is otherwiſe. And therefore if the leſſor doe by words of covenant only promiſe to <note place="margin">Dier 272.</note> his leſſee that he ſhall have a new leaſe, and doe never actually make him; this is no ſurrender in law, <note n="a" place="margin">Dier 178. 177.

Co. ſuper Lit. 338. Co. 6. 69. 10. 53. 67. 5. 11. Dier 280.</note> leaſe be to begin preſently, and the ſecond be to begin at a day to come, or <hi>è converſo:</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Dier 93. 112.</note> and albeit there be a mean eſtate between, as if land be let to <hi>A</hi> for years, and after let to <hi>B</hi> for years, to begin after the firſt term, and the aſſignee of <hi>A</hi> doth take a new leaſe: So if one demiſe land for ten years to one, and after demiſe it for ten years to another, to begin at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and after the firſt leſſee accept a new leaſe. For in all theſe caſes there is a ſurrender in law of the firſt leaſes. And if there be two leſſes for life, or <note place="margin">Dier 46. Co. 2. 60.</note> years, and one of them take a new leaſe for years, this is a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his moity; whereby it doth appear that a ſurrender in law <note place="margin">Co. 6. 69. 10. 67.</note> may be made of ſome eſtates w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> cannot be ſurrendred by a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in fait; for <hi>fortior eſt diſpoſitio legis quam hominis.</hi> And hence it is that a corporation aggregate may make a ſurrender in law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deed, although it cannot make an expreſſe ſurrender without deed. But if the leſſee doe only licence the leſſor to make a feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to give livery of ſeiſin: or doe give livery of ſeiſin for <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 608. Bro. Surrender 48. Trin. 5 Jac.</note> him as his Atturney. or doe licence him to enter into the land and no more, neither of theſe things ſhall be ſaid to be a ſurrender in law. So if the ſecond leaſe be made of another, and not of the ſame thing whereof the firſt leaſe is made, as where the firſt leaſe is of the land, and the ſecond is made of a rent or other profit to be <note place="margin">Co. 6. 69.</note> taken out of the land, or the firſt is of a Manor, and the ſecond of <note place="margin">Adjudged.</note> the Bayliwick or Stewardſhip of the Manor, or the firſt is of a Park, and the ſecond is of the Keeperſhip of the Park; in theſe caſes there is no ſurrender of the firſt leaſe. Alſo if the ſecond leaſe be not a good leaſe, perhaps it ſhall not be conſtrued a ſurrender. See <hi>Co. 2. Lanes</hi> caſe 17.</p>
               <p>But if the firſt leaſe be of the land it ſelf, and the ſecond leaſe is <note place="margin">Trin. 5. Jac. Sir Jo. Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain. caſe. See Dier 200.</note> of the veſture of the ſame land, this is held to be a ſurrender of the firſt leaſe. <note n="*" place="margin">Co. 5. 11.</note> So if the ſecond leaſe be not to begin untill the firſt leaſe end, the taking of this ſecond leaſe is no ſurrender of the firſt leaſe. So it hath been ſaid if one make a leaſe of black acre in Dale, and the leſſee accept a ſecond leaſe of all the lands of the leſſor in Dale in generall words, and the leſſor that doth make the leaſe have divers other lands there beſides this acre, that this is no ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the firſt leaſe. <hi>Sed quere</hi> of this, for others do much doubt <note place="margin">Per Curiam B. R. 9. Jac.</note> it. So if one enter into land, &amp; make a leaſe for the triall of the title only, and after the leſſor (he and the leſſee being both out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion)
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115677:158"/> make another leaſe of the ſame thing to the leſſee; it ſeems this is no ſurrender of the firſt leaſe: but if the leſſor enter before he make the leaſe <hi>contra.</hi> To make a good ſurrender in deed of <note place="margin">See Perk. in his chap. of Surrender <hi>in toto.</hi> Bro. Surrender <hi>in toto.</hi> Fitz. Surrender <hi>in toto.</hi> Co. ſuper Lit. 338.</note> lands, and to make them to paſſe by ſuch a ſurrender, theſe things <note place="margin">5. What ſhall be ſaid a ſurrender in deed of lands. And when they ſhall be ſaid to paſſe by ſuch a ſurrender, Or not, 1. In reſpect of the perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom it is made, and their eſtate and poſſeſſion.</note> are firſt of all required. 1. That the ſurrendror be a perſon able to grant and make, and the ſurrendree a perſon capable and able to take and receive a ſurrender, and that they both have ſuch eſtates as are capable of a ſurrender. And for this purpoſe, 1. That the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendror have an eſtate in poſſeſſion of the thing ſurrendred at the time of the ſurrender made, and not a bare right thereunto only. 2. That the ſurrender be to him that hath the next immediate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in remainder or reverſion, and that there be no intervenient eſtate coming between. 3. That there be a privity of eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſurrendror and the ſurrendree. 4. That the ſurrendree have a higher and greater eſtate in the thing ſurrendred, then the ſurrendror hath, ſo that the eſtate of the ſurrendror may be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein. 5. That he have the eſtate in his own right, and not in the right of his wife &amp;c. 6. And that he be ſole ſeiſed of this eſtate in remainder or reverſion, and not in jointenancy. As for examples, infants, women covert, mad and lunatick men, and all ſuch like perſons, as are diſabled to grant, are diſabled to make a ſurrender, and none but ſuch as may grant their land may ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their land. A Corporation aggregate of many cannot make an expreſſe ſurrender without a deed, but it may make ſuch a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render <note place="margin">Co. 10. 67.</note> by deed. And ſuch perſons as are diſabled to take by a grant are diſabled to take by a ſurrender, and ſuch as may bee grantees, may be ſurrendrees; and therefore a ſurrender made to an infant is good. If the husband have a leaſe or eſtate for years in the right <note place="margin">Husband and wife.</note> of his wife, he alone, or he and his wife together may ſurrender <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 613. 612. Bro. ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 44.</note> this; but if the husband have an eſtate for life in the right of his wife, being tenant in dower or otherwiſe, and he alone, or hee and ſhee together ſurrender this; this ſurrender is good onely during the life of the husband, except it bee made by fine. One <note place="margin">21 H. 7. 25.</note> execut or may ſurrender an eſtate or leaſe for years which the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors <note place="margin">Executors. Tenant in common.</note> have in the right of their teſtator. If there be two tenants in common, and one of them have the particular eſtate, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Perk. ſect. 586, 587. Fitz. ſur. 2.</note> the fee ſimple; as where an eſtate is limited to two and the heirs of one of them, and he that hath the eſtate for life doth ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his part to a ſtranger; in this caſe the alienee may ſurrender to the other jointenant: So if there be three jointenants for life, and the fee ſimple is limited to the heirs of one of them; and one of the jointenants for life doth releaſe to the other, and he to whom this <note place="margin">Iointenant.</note> releaſe is made doth ſurrender to him that hath the fee ſimple; this is a good ſurrender of a third part. But otherwiſe one jointenant cannot ſurrender to another jointenant, albeit he be tenant for life
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115677:159"/> which doth make, and he tenant in fee ſimple, that doth take the <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 584.

A leſſee for life or years, may ſurrender to him that is next in remainder in fee ſimple, or fee tail, or to him in reverſion in fee, and this is a good ſurrender, and a ſurrender as it ſeems may be made to the grantee of the reverſion before atturnment, ſo as atturnment be afterwards made. And in caſe of the ſurrender of <note place="margin">Dier 251. 358. 280.</note> an eſtate for life there needs no livery of ſeiſin as in caſe of the grant <note place="margin">Livery of ſeiſin.</note> of an eſtate for life. A leſſee for years of a term to begin at a day <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 601, 602. 4 H. 7. 10. Co. 6. 69.</note> to come cannot ſurrender it by an actuall ſurrender before the day the term begin, as he may by a ſurrender in law. <note n="a" place="margin">Perk. Sect. 600, 601, 602, 603.</note> If leſſee for life be diſſeiſed, or leſſee for years be ouſted, and before his entry or the getting of the poſſeſſion again, he ſurrender his eſtate to him in reverſion; this ſurrender is void. So if a woman that hath ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of dower ſurrender it to him in reverſion before ſhe hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it; this ſurrender is void. And yet if leſſee for years after his term is begun &amp; before his entry, when no body doth keep from him the profits, doe ſurrender his eſtate; it ſeems this is a good ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; but if another enter before him, and keep him out, it ſeems otherwiſe. If there be leſſee for years, the remainder for life, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder or reverſion in fee, &amp; the leſſee for years be outſted, &amp; he that <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 605. Dier 251.</note> outſted him die ſeiſed, &amp; then the leſſee for years enter, and then the tenant for life ſurrender to him in remainder or reverſion in fee; this is not a good ſurrender, for there is in this caſe but a bare right of remainder for life and in fee; but if the leſſee for years had not been ouſted, it had been a good ſurrender. If there be leſſee for years, the remainder for life, the remainder in fee; the leſſee for years may ſurrender to the leſſee for life, and ſo may the tenant for life to him in remainder or reverſion in fee, but if there be tenant for life, the remainder for life, the remainder in fee; in this caſe the ſecond te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life cannot ſurrender to him in remainder in fee. If a leaſe <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 588.</note> bee made for life or years to <hi>A,</hi> the remainder for life to <hi>B,</hi> the remainder in fee tail to <hi>C,</hi> and the firſt tenant for life or years doth ſurrender to <hi>C,</hi> or to the leſſor, <hi>B</hi> being the next in remainder for life being then living; this is not a good ſurrender, neither can it take effect as a ſurrender in reſpect of the intervenient eſtate. And ſo ſome ſay the law is if the middle remainder be but for years on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: as if a leaſe be made for years, the remainder for years, and the firſt termor ſurrender his intereſt to the leſſor; this is no good ſurrender. <hi>Sed quere.</hi> For it ſhould ſeem that a future iutereſt will <note place="margin">Dier 112. Plow. 190. Dier 93. Plow. 432, 433.</note> no more hinder an actuall ſurrender of the firſt leſſee, then a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in law. And ſo alſo it ſeems the law is for a concurrent leaſe, which for the latter part of it is in the nature of a future intereſt. But if in this caſe it fall out the middle remainder be void; as where a leaſe is made to <hi>A</hi> for life, or years, the remainder to a monk (who is a perſon uncapable) for life or years, the remainder to <hi>I S</hi> in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115677:159"/> fee; in this caſe <hi>A</hi> the firſt tenant may ſurrender to him in remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in fee, and the ſurrender is good. If leſſee for 20 years make a <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 604. 14 H. 7. 3. Plow. 541. Bro. Sur. 16.</note> leaſe for 5 years, and the leſſee for 5 years enter, and after the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee for 20 years ſurrender to him in reverſion or remainder; this is a good ſurrender. So alſo if the two leſſees join in the ſurrender. So alſo if the firſt leſsee ſurrender firſt, and the leſsee for 5 years ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render after. But if the leſſee for five years ſurrender to him in the reverſion or the remainder before the ſurrender of the leſſee for 20 years; this cannot take effect as a ſurrender for two cauſes: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a remnant of the term as an intervenient eſtate to hinder the drowning of the terme. 2. Becauſe there wants a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity between the leſſee for five years, and him in reverſion. If te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">Bro. ſur. 9. Fitz. ſur. 10.</note> in fee ſimple ſurrender to the Lord Paramount of whom the land is held; this can never take effect as a ſurrender, unleſſe it be in a ſpeciall caſe where the Lord hath cauſe to have a <hi>Ceſſavit.</hi> So if tenant in tail ſurrender to him in remainder or reverſion in <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 590. Perk. Sect. 589. Co. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lit. 42. 3. 61. Perk. Sect. 590.</note> fee ſimple; this cannot take effect as a ſurrender. So if leſſee for life ſurrender to him in remainder for years: or tenant for the life of <hi>B</hi> ſurrender to him that hath an eſtate for the life of <hi>C,</hi> theſe are void ſurrenders, for the eſtates of them to whom they are made, are not capable of ſuch ſurrenders, for they are not greater then the eſtates of the ſurrendrors, and therefore not able to drown the eſtates ſurrendred. And yet if leſſee for the life of another, or for his own life ſurrender his eſtate to him in remainder that is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for his own life; this is a good ſurrender, for an eſtate for a mans own life is greater in judgement of law, then an eſtate for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans life. And hence it is that if a leaſe bee made to two for their lives, the remainder to a third perſon for his own life, and one of the firſt tenants for life ſurrender his eſtate unto him in remainder for life; this is a good ſurrender for a moity. If leſſee <note place="margin">Co. 2. 66.</note> for life or yeares ſurrender to him in remainder or reverſion that hath no good eſtate in the remainder or reverſion, as where the remainder or reverſion is granted by word only, or being granted by deed there is no atturnment of the tenant to the grant, or the the like; this ſurrender is not good. And yet if tenant in taile <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 338.</note> make a leaſe for life whereby he gaineth a new reverſion (but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible) and the tenant for life doth ſurrender to the tenant in tail; this ſhall be a good ſurrender. So if a woman inheritrix have a husband, and they have iſſue a ſonne, and the husband di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſhe take another husband, and he letteth the land for life, and the wife dieth, and the tenant for life doth ſurrender his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to the ſecond husband; this is a good ſurrender to moſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
               <p>If a feme ſole be ſeiſed of land in fee, and ſhe make a leaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 622.</note> to a ſtranger for life, and then take a husband, and the leſſee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115677:160"/> to the husband; this is no good ſurrender, neither can it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure ſo, becauſe he to whom it is made hath not the reverſion in his own but in his wives right.</p>
               <p>It is further alſo required in every good ſurrender, that if it be <note place="margin">Bro. ſur. 2. 8. Fitz. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition 5. Perk. Sect. 583.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the place where it is made.

And a ſurrender may be by word or writing of lands lying within the ſame County in any place out of the land. And therefore if tenant for life ſurrender to him in reverſion in any place out of the land within the ſame County, and the ſurrendree agree to it, the freehold is in him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. 3. That it be made of ſuch things, of which a ſurrender <note place="margin">Bro. ſurrend. <hi>in toto.</hi> Per. chap. Sur. <hi>in toto.</hi> Co. 5. 11. ſuper Lit. 338.</note> may be made. For ſurrenders may not be made of eſtates in fee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or fee taile, nor yet of rights or titles onely of eſtates for life or years, nor yet of part of an eſtate for life or years, as if a man have a leaſe for ten years, he cannot ſurrender the laſt ſeven years, and keep to himſelf the three years. But otherwiſe one may ſurrender any kinde of eſtate for life, as by dower, by the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or as tenant in tail after poſſibility of iſſue extinct, or for years, or years determinable upon lives, and that of any meſuages, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, lands, commons, rents, or the like, that are grantable from one to another, and ſuch ſurrenders are good. 4. That there be <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 607, 608, 609. Dier 251. Bro. ſur. 1. 35. 37. 17. 21 H. 7. 7.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">4. In reſpect of the manner. And how and by what words a ſurrender may be made. And where it may be made without deed, and upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Or not.</note> words, or words and deeds ſufficient to make the mind of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendror to appear that he is willing and deſirous to part with and yeeld up the thing ſurrendred into the hands of the ſurrendree. And herein it is to be known that albeit the words Surrender, Give, or Yeeld up, be the moſt ſignificant &amp; proper words whereby to make a ſurrender, yet any other words, eſpecially if it be in the ſurrender of a leaſe for years, that do teſtifie and declare the will and aſſent of him that is the particular tenant that he in the remainder or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſhall have the eſtate of the tenant, be ſufficient to paſſe the eſtate by way of ſurrender. And therefore if leſſee for life or years doe by word or writing ſay, That he will hold the land no longer, and wiſh him in reverſion or remainder therefore to enter: Or that it is his deſire that he ſhall enter into the land, and have it and his eſtate therein: Or that he is content that he ſhall have his eſtate, or have his leaſe; ſuch, or any ſuch like declaration as this made to him in reverſion or remainder, will be a good ſurrender. So if <note place="margin">Hil. 37 El. B. R. Sleigh &amp; Batemans caſe.</note> leſſee for years deliver his Indenture to a ſtranger, to deliver it and all his eſtate up to him in reverſion, and doe appoint the ſtranger to deliver and ſurrender it to him in reverſion, and he doe ſo, and he in reverſion accept thereof; this is a good ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; but otherwiſe it is of an eſtate for life. So if the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular tenant doe by the words Give, Grant, or Confirm, paſſe his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115677:160"/> to him in reverſion, and he doe enter and agree to it; this is a good ſurrender: And by all theſe ſurrenders the eſtates wil paſſe by way of ſurrender, except it be in ſome ſpeciall caſes where the intent of the parties doth plainly appear to bee that the eſtate ſhall not paſſe by way of ſurrender. But if a leſſee for life or years doe onely goe from the houſe or land, and carry away his goods and cattell, and ſo waive the poſſeſſion for a time, either becauſe the leſſor ſhall not diſtrain them for rent behind, or the like, and thereupon the leſſor doth enter and enjoy it; this is no ſurrender, neither is this a good yeelding up of his eſtate. And in ſuch a manner and by ſuch words as before, any thing that may be <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 581, 582. 583. Fitz. ſur. 1. Co. ſuper Lit. 338.</note> granted by word without writing, may bee ſurrendred by word without writing, ſo as it be made within the ſame County where the thing ſurrendred doth lie. And this holdeth true albeit the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to bee ſurrendred were created by deed: But ſuch things, as commons, rents, advowſons, reverſions, remainders, and the like, that cannot bee granted without deed cannot bee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred without deed. And therefore if a leaſe be made for life, the remainder for life by word of mouth without any writing; he in the remainder for life cannot ſurrender his remainder for life without deed. So where one hath a rent, advowſon, or the like, as tenant in dower, or by the courteſie; this cannot bee ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">Dier 251. Bro. Sur. 16.</note> without deed. And in caſe where there is any ſpeciall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be contained in the ſurrender, as reſervation of rent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or the like, there for the moſt part it muſt be by deed; or it will not be good. And therefore if tenant for life declare himſelf by word of mouth to be contented and agreed that he in the reverſion ſhall have the land and his eſtate therein, rendring ten ſhillings a years rent; or paying ſuch a ſumme of money, or upon condition that if he ſurvive the leſſor he ſhall have it again <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 624. 623. Co. ſuper 218.</note> &amp;c. this is no good ſurrender. And a ſurrender may be made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon a condition precedent or ſubſequent, as if it be with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of rent that if it be not paid it ſhall be void; but if it be an eſtate for life that is ſo ſurrendred, it ſeems it muſt be made by writing indented, and ſo likewiſe it ſhould ſeem the law is of the ſurrender of a leaſe for years upon a condition, or however it is moſt ſafe ſo to doe. 5. That the ſurrendree doe agree to, and <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 608. Lit. Bro. 163.</note> accept of it, for untill then the ſurrender is not perfect, but if the <note place="margin">5.

But the actuall entry of the ſurrendree into the land is not neceſſary. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if tenant for life or years ſurrender to him in reverſion out of the land, and he agree to it, he hath the land in him preſently. And yet he may not bring any action of Treſpaſſe againſt any man

               <p>But here note, that in the caſes before where things may not <note place="margin">Perk. Sect. 588, 589.</note> paſſe by way of ſurrender, either becauſe of an intervenient eſtate, or the like; if there be ſufficient words in the deed, it may avail to other purpoſes, and may enure and paſſe the thing by way of grant; but then if it be an eſtate for life that is intended to bee ſurrendred, there muſt be livery of ſeiſin made upon the deed. And wherefore if there bee leſſee for yeares, the remainder for life or years, the remainder in fee, and the leſſee for years in poſſeſſion doth ſurrender and grant all his eſtate to him in remainder in fee; howſoever this deed cannot enure as a ſurrender, yet it ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure as a good grant of the eſtate of the leſſee for years unto him in remainder in fee.</p>

And hence it is that if one confirm all his eſtate that he hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to another, when in truth he hath granted none at all; this is void. And ſo alſo it is if there be an eſtate and no poſſeſſion: as if a diſſeiſor make a leaſe for years to begin at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">4 H. 7. 10.</note> the day the diſſeiſee doth confirme the eſtate of the leſſee for years; it is ſaid this is not a good confirmation, <hi>ſed quaere.</hi> 3.

So if leſſee for life make a leaſe for thirty yeares, and after he in reverſion and the <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 296.</note> leſſee for life leaſe for ſixty yeares; in this caſe he cannot confirme the leaſe for thirty yeares becauſe he hath granted it before for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares.

And yet if one Jointenant confirme the whole land to his companion To have and to hold the land to him and his heires; this ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a Grant, and ſo will be good to paſſe his moity. And hence <note place="margin">Lit. Sect. 543.

The precedent eſtate muſt continue untill the confirmation come, as in all the caſes of voidable eſtates made the confirmation muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eſtates be made void by entry &amp;c. or otherwiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation will be void. And therefore if leſſee for life or yeares ſurrender, or the diſſeiſee enter upon the diſſeiſor, and after the leſſor or the diſſeiſee confirme the eſtate of the leſſee or diſſeiſor; this confirmation comes too late. 5. The eſtate precedent and <note place="margin">Co. 5. 15. Lit. Sect. 607.</note> that which is to be confirmed muſt be lawfull and not prohibited by any act of Parliament.

And if a leſſee for life or a diſseiſor make a leaſe for life, or yeares, &amp;c. and he in the reverſion, or the diſſeiſee confirme their eſtates, and not the land, and without any <hi>Habendum</hi> or limitation of eſtate; this is good for ſo long as the eſtates do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.

If leſsee for life grant a rent to one and his heires out of the land, and the leſsor doth confirme the eſtate, or this rent charge, this doth make the eſtate of the rent ſure. And ſo alſo if he doe confirme the rent, and ſay To have and to hold to him and his heires; this is a good confirmation. But if he confirm the rent, To have and to hold to him in fee, without naming his heires, hereby his eſtate is not bettered.</p>

               <p>This kind of confirmation <hi>Creſcens</hi> muſt have all the qualities of the former: and there muſt be alſo in this caſe a privity between <note place="margin">Co. 9. 142. ſuper Lit. 305.

But if a man be ſeiſed of an old rent-charge or rent-ſervice, and grant the ſame firſt for life, and after confirme the eſtate of the grantee in fee ſimple, or fee taile; this is good and will enlarge the eſtate accordingly.</p>
               <p>If tenant for life grant a rent out of the land to one and his heirs <note place="margin">Co. 1. 147.</note> during the life of the leſſee for life, and after the leſſor confirme the rent to the grantee and his heires; it ſeems the eſtate is not hereby enlarged, but when the tenant for life doth die the rent ſhall ceaſe.</p>
               <p>This kind of confirmation may be made by the ſame words as <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 301. Fitz.

But neither of theſe may be made by the words, Surrender, Releaſe, Exchange, or the like, for theſe are peculiar words deſtined to a ſpeciall end being proper and peculiar manner of conveyances. And yet if I that am a leſſor do ſay to my leſſee for yeares by my deed, I will that you ſhall hold the land for your life; this is a good confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to increaſe the eſtate by this word <hi>volo</hi> only. So if I grant to my leſſee for yeares, that he ſhall hold the land for terme of his life; this without any other words is a good confirmation.</p>
               <p>By a confirmation the Lord may confirme the eſtate of his tenant <note place="margin">Co. 9. 142. Lit.

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Of a Releaſe.</head>
               <p>A Releaſe is the giving or diſcharging of the right or action <note place="margin">Terms of the law. Weſt Symb. lib. 2. Sect. 466.</note>

                  </note> which a man hath or may have or claime againſt another man or that which is his. Or it is the conveyance of a mans intereſt or right which he hath unto a thing to another that hath the poſſeſſion thereof or ſome eſtate therein. And this albeit it may be made by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, as <hi>Dedi, Conceſſi,</hi> or <hi>Renunciaſſe,</hi> or ſuch like, yet it is moſt commonly and properly made by theſe words <hi>Remiſiſſe, Relaxaſſe, &amp; quietum clamaſſe,</hi> all which are much to one purpoſe. He that <note place="margin">Releſſor, Releſſee.</note> makes the releaſe is ſometimes called the releſſor, and hee to whom it is made the releſſee.</p>
               <p>There are two kindes of releaſes like unto thoſe of confirmation, <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 264. 265.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Quotuplex.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> a releaſe expreſſe or in deed, and that is a purpoſed releaſe, when the act done or deed made is intended a releaſe. And this is alwaies done by writing. And then it is defined by ſome to be an Inſtrument whereby eſtates, rights, titles, actions, and other things be ſometimes extinguiſhed, ſometimes transferred, ſometimes abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and ſometimes enlarged, which is after this manner. <hi>Noverint &amp;c. me A de Bremiſiſſe, relaxaſſe &amp; omnino de me [vel prome] &amp; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. meis quietum clamaſſe C de D totum jus, titulum &amp; clameum que habui, habeo vel quoviſmodo in futuro habere potero de &amp; in unto meſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agio cum pertin in F &amp;c.</hi> And a releaſe implied or in law, and that is when the law by intendment and conſtruction and by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent doth make a releaſe of an act done to another purpoſe. And this is ſometimes by writing, and ſometimes without writing. Theſe releaſes alſo are ſometimes of a bare and naked right, and ſometimes of a right accompanied with ſome eſtate or intereſt. And ſometimes they are of actions reall or in lands or tenements, and ſometimes of actions perſonall of or in goods or chattells, and ſometimes of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mixt partly in the realty and partly in the perſonalty.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:115677:167"/>
               <p>A releaſe is much of the nature of a confirmation, for in moſt <note place="margin">3. The nature and operation of it in generall.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 193. 273. 277. Co. 1. 147. Lit. Sect. 606. 459. 465, 466. 446.</note> things they agree and produce the like effects. This therefore is ſaid ſometimes to enure by way of <hi>mitter le eſtate. i.</hi> by way of giving or transferring or enlargement of an eſtate or intereſt, and ſo doth give ſome new intereſt or eſtate to him to whom it is made. And ſometimes it is ſaid to enure by way of <hi>mitter le droit</hi> only. <hi>i.</hi> by way of giving, transferring and diſcharging of a right title or entry unto him to whom it is made. And ſo it doth ſometimes perfect an eſtate that was imperfect and defeaſible before, and enure by way of entry and feoffement. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo it doth enure to make a conditionall eſtate abſolute. And ſometimes alſo it doth worke and enure by way of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment or diſcharge: And then alſo ſometimes it doth enure by way of diſcharge or extinguiſhment as againſt all perſons, and ſo as that whereof all perſons may take advantage. And ſometimes it doth enure only as a diſcharge againſt ſome perſons only, and as to or againſt other perſons by way of <hi>Mitter le droit.</hi> And ſome of theſe in deed enure by way of extinguiſhment, for that he to whom the releaſe is made can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the thing releaſed. And ſome of them have ſome quality of ſuch releaſes and are ſaid to enure by way of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment, but in truth doe not, for that he to whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe is made may receive and take the thing releaſed. And in ſome caſes alſo a releaſe like a confirmation doth enure by way of abridgement. But a man cannot barre himſelfe hereby of a right that ſhall come to him hereafter. And therefore it is held that theſe words uſed in releaſes <hi>[quae quoviſmodo in futuro habere potero]</hi> are to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Lands, tenements and hereditaments themſelves may be given <note place="margin">4. What things may be releaſed. Or not.

Alſo all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reall, perſonall and mixt, may be given, diſcharged or extinct by releaſe; for howſoever rights and titles of entry cannot be granted by act of the party, nor any action may be granted from one man to another by act of the law or the party, yet all theſe may be releaſed to the terretenant. And a right to a free hold or Inheritance, ſeigniory or rent <hi>in preſenti</hi> or <hi>futuro</hi> may be releaſed five manner of waies, and the firſt three waies without any privity at all. 1. To the tenant of the free hold in deed or in law. 2. To him in the remainder. 3. To him in reverſion. The other two waies in reſpect of privity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any eſtate or right, as by demandant to vouchee, donor

               <p>Alſo poſſibilities of land &amp;c. if they be neere and common <note place="margin">Co. 10. 47. 51, 52, 5. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Co. 1. 113. 174.</note> poſſibilities albeit they be not grantable over to another perſon, yet may they be releaſed to him that hath the preſent eſtate of the land. And therefore if a man poſſeſſed of a terme deviſe it to <hi>A</hi> for life, the remainder to <hi>B</hi> and his heires males during the terme; in this caſe albeit <hi>B</hi> may not grant his intereſt over yet he may releaſe it to <hi>A.</hi> And if <hi>A</hi> deviſe to <hi>B</hi> twenty pound when he comes to the age of twenty foure years, and die; in this caſe <hi>B</hi> after he is of the age of twenty one years may releaſe this legacy. So a covenant to doe a future act may be releaſed before it be broken. And it ſeems alſo the conuſee of a Statute or recogniſance may releaſe to a feoffee of part of the land and ſo barre himſelfe of execution of that land. And if I grant to <hi>I S</hi> that if he doe ſuch a thing he ſhall have an annuity of twenty pound for his life; in this caſe it ſeems <hi>I S</hi> may releaſe this before the condition be performed. And if I make a feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>I S</hi> to divers uſes with power to revoke it; I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe this power to one that hath an eſtate of free hold in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, reverſion or remainder in the land. And yet if I make a feoffment to <hi>I S</hi> with proviſo that if <hi>B</hi> revoke that the uſes ſhall ceaſe; in this caſe <hi>B</hi> cannot releaſe this power. And a remote poſſibility that is altogether incertaine cannot be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And therefore if the ſonne of the diſſeiſee releaſe to the diſſeiſor in the life time of his father; this releaſe is void. And ſo if the conuſee of a Statute releaſe his right to the land of the conuſor before execution; this releaſe is void. And ſo if a plaintife releaſe to a Baile in the Kings Bench before Judgement given, this releaſe is void.</p>
               <p>So if one promiſe to pay me tenne pound upon the ſurrender <note place="margin">Adjudge Tr. 14. Jac. B. R.</note> of my land to him, and that if he ſhall ſell it for above fifty pound that then he ſhall pay me tenne pound more, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe this to him before he doe ſell it and before I do ſurrender; im this caſe this doth not releaſe the ſecond promiſe becauſe it is not releaſable.</p>
               <p>Alſo debts, legacies, and other duties may be releaſed and <note place="margin">See in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> diſcharged thereby before or after they become due. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a rent or annuity may be releaſed before the day of paiment. And ſo alſo may a debt due by obligation: Judgements, Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Recogniſances, and the like, by apt words be diſcharged by releaſe.</p>

And yet a man may releaſe his right in a part of the land. And therefore if a man be diſſeiſed of two acres, he may releaſe his right in one of them and enter into the other acre. Alſo a releaſe in the nature of an acquitance may <note place="margin">Adjudged Barkley &amp; Perkes caſe. Hil. 9 Car. B. R.</note> be of part of a debt.

So if one make a leaſe for life, and grant the reverſion for life, and then the leſſor doth releaſe to the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the reverſion and his heires; this is a good releaſe to enlarge the eſtate of the grantee, and here is privity enough.

So if a man make a leaſe for twenty yeares, and the leſſee make a leaſe for tenne yeares, and the firſt leſſor doth releaſe to the ſecond leſſee and his heires; this releaſe is void. So alſo if the donee in taile make a leaſe for his own life, and the donor releaſe to the leſſee and his heires; this releaſe is void. So alſo if the donee in taile make a leaſe for his owne life, and after the donor releaſe to the donee and his heires; it ſeems this is not a good releaſe. Alſo one Jointenant or coparcener may <note place="margin">Bro. Releaſe 77. Perk.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115677:170"/> in fee and they make a leaſe for life, and after two of them releaſe all their right in the land to the third; this is a good releaſe. So if one make a leaſe for life to another, and after the grant the reverſion to ſeven and the tenant for life doth atturn, and after four of the ſeven releaſe all their right to the other three and after one of the three releaſe to the other two; theſe are good releaſes. So if a leaſe for yeares be made to two, to begin at a day to come, a releaſe by one of them to the other is good to give all the terme and all the land to the releſsee.

And a mongſt theſe the word Releaſe is the moſt effectuall word, as that which doth include the other two, and as that which is the proper and peculiar word for this kind of conveyance. But there are other <note place="margin">9 H. 6. 35. Dier 116. Lit. Sect. 544. Co. ſuper Lit. 264. Dier 307. Co. 9. 52.</note> words alſo by which a releaſe may be made, as <hi>Renunciare, Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etare, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore it is held that if one have common in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers land, and he by deed releaſe it to him thus: <hi>Renuntio Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam meam &amp;c.</hi> this is a good releaſe. And if the leſſor doe but grant to his leſſee for life that he ſhall be diſcharged of the rent; this is a good releaſe of the rent. And it is a rule, That by what words a debt or duty may be created, by words of a contrary ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification it may be releaſed. And therefore if one doe knowledge himſelfe to be ſatisfied and diſcharged a debt, this is a good releaſe of the debt. And for words to raiſe the eſtate it is uſuall and moſt <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 273. Lit. Sect. 465. 468, 469.</note> ſafe to ſpecifie in the deed what eſtate he to whom the releaſe is made ſhall have; and in moſt caſes this is needfull: for it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true, That when a releaſe doth enure by way of enlargment of eſtate no inheritance in fee ſimple or fee taile can paſſe without apt words of inheritance. And therefore if I make a leaſe of land to another for his life, and after I releaſe to him all my right without more ſaying in the releaſe; hereby his eſtate is not enlarged. But if I releaſe to him and his heires; by this he hath a fee ſimple. And if I releaſe to him and the heires of his body; by this he hath an eſtate taile. But where a releaſe worketh by way of <hi>mitter le eſtate</hi> there in ſome caſes there needs not any words of inheritance, as in caſes where releaſes are made between Jointenants or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parceners, as where a joint eſtate is made to the husband and wife and a third perſon and their heires, and the third perſon doth
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115677:171"/> releaſe all his right to the husband alone, or to the wife alone. So if there be three Jointenants, and one of them doth releaſe to one of the other two; in all theſe and ſuch like caſes there needs not any limitation of the eſtate, for the releaſe is good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>In every good releaſe in deed that doth tend and enure to give <note place="margin">Lit. Sect. 466 Co. ſuper Lit. 265. Co. 5. 70, 71. 1. 112. 8. 132.</note>

               <p n="1">1. That he that doth make it hath at the time of the releaſe made ſome right or title to releaſe. As where one doth diſſeiſe me of land, and I releaſe to him all my right in the land; this is a good releaſe. So if one diſſeiſe my tenant for life, and I (being the next in remainder or reverſion in fee) do releaſe to him that did make the diſſeiſin; this is a good releaſe. So if the husband make a leaſe for life, and then take a wife and dieth, and the wife re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe her dower to him in reverſion; this is a good releaſe. And ſo alſo if after the mariage a man make a leaſe for life the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in fee, and ſhee releaſe all her right to him in remainder in fee or to him in reverſion; this is a good releaſe and will barre her for ever.</p>
               <p>And therefore if the Releſſor have only a poſſibility of a right, <note place="margin">Lit. Sect. 446. Co. 10. 47. 42. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lit. 265.</note> or a right happen to come to him after the releaſe; this is not ſufficient to make the releaſe good. And therefore if the father be diſseiſed, and the ſon before his fathers death releaſe all his right to the diſseiſor, and after the father dieth, ſo that the right doth deſcend; this is no good releaſe to bar the Releſſor of his right. So if there be grandfather, father and ſon, and the father diſſeiſe the grandfather, and make a feoffement, and the ſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe in the life time of his father, and after the father and grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die; this releaſe in this caſe will not bar him. So if a leaſe <note place="margin">Co. 10. 57.</note> be made for life, the remainder to the right heirs of <hi>I S,</hi> and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee is diſseiſed, and the eldeſt ſon of <hi>I S</hi> living, his father doth releaſe to the diſſeiſor; this releaſe is void. So if the conuſee of a ſtatute &amp;c. doe releaſe to the conuſor all his right in the land; this is void <note place="margin">Co. 5. 70.</note> and he may ſue execution after notwithſtanding. Or if the Releſſor <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 265.</note> have only a power, this is not ſufficient to make the releaſe good. And therefore if a man by his will deviſe that his executors ſhall ſell his land, and dieth, and the executors releaſe all their right and title in the land to the heirs; this releaſe is void.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In all caſes of a releaſe of a bare right of a freehold in lands <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115677:171"/> whereof the releaſe is made; for rights of entry, and actions, and the like, are not to be transferred to ſtrangers, but are thus to be releaſed, and ſuch releaſes are good. As if the diſſeiſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe to the diſſeiſor himſelf who hath the freehold in deed, or to the heir of the diſſeiſor before his entry, who hath the freehold in law, or to the leſſee for life of the diſſeiſor; theſe releaſes are good. So if a diſseiſor make a leaſe to <hi>A</hi> and his heirs during the life of <hi>B,</hi> and <hi>A</hi> die, and the diſseiſee releaſe to his heir before his entry; this is a good releaſe. So if a fine <hi>ſur conuſance de droit come ceo &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>ſur conuſance de droit</hi> only (which is a <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 266. 275. Lit. ſect. 448. 1 H 6. 4.

And therefore a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe to them of the right of the land by him that hath it is good, and will bar the Releſsor. But otherwiſe it is in caſes of Exchange, Partition, or upon Livery within the view, for in theſe caſes no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe is good untill an actuall entry made, for till then they have neither freehold in right nor law. So if a diſseiſor make a gift <note place="margin">Lit.

But if any rent be reſerved on the eſtate tail, the rent is gone by the releaſe. So if a leaſe be made to one for life rendring rent, and the leſsee is diſseiſed, and the leſsor releaſe to the leſsee and his heirs all his right; in this caſe albeit the rent be extinct, yet nothing of the right of the reverſion doth paſſe. And yet if a woman that hath right of dower releaſe to the guardian in Chivalry: this is a good releaſe, and her right or title of dower is gone. But if a diſseiſor make a leaſe for years, and the diſseiſee releaſe to the leſsee for years; this releaſe is void becauſe he hath no freehold. But if he make a leaſe for life, and the diſseiſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe to the leſsee for life; this is a good releaſe. So alſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe to the diſseiſor after the leaſe for years made is good. And <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 265.</note> if leſsee for years be ouſted, and he in the reverſion diſseiſed, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115677:172"/> the diſseiſor make a leaſe for years, and the firſt leſsee releaſe to him; this is a good releaſe. Alſo in ſome caſes a releaſe made to <note place="margin">Lit. Sect. 448, 449, 450, 451. Co. 8. 151.</note> one that hath neither freehold in deed, nor freehold in law, is good when he hath an eſtate in reverſion or remainder, as in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where a releaſe is made by the diſſeiſee to the diſſeiſor after he hath made an eſtate for life. So if the demandant in a reall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on releaſe to the tenant that comes in by receipt upon a prayer of aid or voucher upon a warranty; this is good. And yet if it be before the receipt, or entry into the warranty, or it be by any other beſides the demandant, it is void. So if the tenant in a reall action alien hanging the <hi>precipe quod reddat</hi> againſt him, and after alienation the plaintiff releaſe all his right in the land to him, this is a good releaſe. So if a diſſeiſor make a leaſe for life, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to another for life, the remainder to a third in taile, the remainder to a fourth in fee, and the diſſeiſee releaſe to either of them in remainder; this is a good releaſe. But if in this caſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life be diſſeiſed, and after he that hath right (the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being in the diſſeiſor) doth releaſe to either of them in remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; this is a void releaſe. But in all the caſes of a releaſe of a bare <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 275. Lit. Sect. 470, 471. Co. 10. 48.</note>

For if tenant for life make a leaſe to another for life of the leſſee, the remainder over in fee, and the firſt leſſor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe al his right to him to whom the tenant made the leaſe for life; this is a good releaſe and a perpetuall bar, albeit the releaſe be not to him and his heirs. And ſo it is in caſe of a reverſion.</p>
               <p>If leſſee for years be ouſted, and he in the reverſion diſſeiſed, and the diſſeiſor make a leaſe for years, and the leſſee that is ouſted doth releaſe to the leſſee of the diſſeiſor; this is a good releaſe. And yet if the diſſeiſee doe releaſe to the leſſee for years of the diſſeiſor; this is void.</p>
               <p>If leſſee for a thouſand years be ouſted by the leſſor, and he make a leaſe for two years, and the leſſee for a thouſand years releaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; this is a good releaſe.

So if my diſſeiſor leaſe for life, and the leſſee for life alien in fee, and I releaſe to the alienee all my right &amp;c. this is
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115677:172"/> a good releaſe and will bar me of my entry: but if my entry be gone, as if I leaſe for life, and my leſſee be diſseiſed, and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor is diſseiſed, and I releaſe to the ſecond diſſeiſor; in this caſe the firſt diſseiſor may enter upon the ſecond. So if my diſseiſor in the caſe aforeſaid make a leaſe for life, and the leſſee for life maketh a feoffment to two, and I releaſe to one of the feoffees; this is a good releaſe and will bar me and my diſseiſor alſo. So if tenant for life let the land to another for the life of the leſſee, the remainder to another in fee, and the leſſor releaſe to his tenant for life; this is a good releaſe.</p>
               <p>If one that hath a ſon within age be diſseiſed and die, and the diſseiſor die ſeiſed, and the land deſcend to his heir, and a ſtranger abate, to whom the ſon when he comes of age doth releaſe; this is a good releaſe. So if one be diſſeiſed by an infant which doth alien in fee; and the alienee die ſeiſed, and his heir entreth, the diſſeiſor being within age, and the diſſeiſee releaſe to the heir of the alienee; this is a good releaſe. But where an inheritance or <note place="margin">9 H. 6. 43.</note> an eſtate for life is releaſed to one that is but tenant for years, the releaſe is not good without privity. And therefore if tenant for <note place="margin">Co. 10. 48.</note> life or in fee releaſe to the leſſee for years of his diſseiſor; this is not good. But the releaſe of a term of years to the leſſee for years of him that doth eject him is good enough without privity, as in the caſe before.</p>
               <p>But here note that in caſes of a void releaſe of a right to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. 265.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Warranty.</note> or freehold, where there is a warranty contained in the deed, the warranty may be good, and be uſed by way of rebutter, albeit the releaſe be void. As if the ſon of the diſseiſee releaſe with warranty in the life time of his father, or there be grandfather, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſon, and the father diſseiſe the grandfather, and make a leaſe with warranty and die; in both theſe caſes albeit the ſon be not barred by the releaſe, yet he is barred by the warranty.</p>
               <p>4. Such words as will make a good releaſe in the caſes of relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">Co. ſuper Lit. ſect. 467.</note>

But where by a writ of Error the plaintiffe ſhall not be reſtored to any perſonall or reall thing, this releaſe is no bar: as if a man be outlawed in an action perſonall by proceſſe upon the originall, and bring a writ of Error, and then releaſe; this is no barre to him.</p>

And if the Executor be ſued for debt on an Obligation, he may plead he made voluntary payment of other debts due upon Obligations, or gave new ſecurity for them in his own name before the Suit began, and that he hath no more then enough to ſatisfie them.

If an Action bee brought againſt an Executor or Adminiſtrator on an Eſpecialty for money, it is no good plea in barre of this Action to plead a Statute or Recogniſance with Defeaſance to performe Covenants when there is no Covenant broken.
